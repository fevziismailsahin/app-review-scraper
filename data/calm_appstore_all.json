I originally bought a single month to month membership and then seen that there‚Äôs a family plan option that you can ONLY sign up for on the website.  So I cancelled my app membership and spent $99 for the family plan. I sent the given link to a family member and it didn‚Äôt work.  I tried to contact customer service but I received and automated response saying they would get back to me in 2-3 days.  It‚Äôs day 3, and I all I got was an email saying they‚Äôre still working on the problem. Now I don‚Äôt want any help and just want a refund.  Tried to get a refund and the website said my email wasn‚Äôt connected with any accounts.  So I once again messaged support and got the same b.s. message that it will be 2-3 for a response. What a joke!! For an app that supposed to help with anxiety, it sure did spike it!!  Stay away and find an app with better customer support!!!",

    "text": "I was a long time user of the app - I used the free version from 2012-2017, and then purchased a lifetime subscription in 2017. I also gifted year subs for several friends. It was my favorite app until I discovered Tamara Levitt is openly Zionist. She literally follows the state of Israel on her IG. Maybe that‚Äôs unfortunately not surprising given the tech industry, not to mention Jay Shetty is a scammer who takes other people‚Äôs experiences and plagiarizes them for his social media content (also think about it - what actual monk would decide to go corporate and have an incredibly expensive and inaccessible ‚Äúschool‚Äù for coaches - scam, money grab). It creeps me out to think of all the daily meditations I had listened to with Tamara‚Äôs voice, literal years of daily dedicated listening and realizing now that she, like many Zionist therapists and meditation instructors, has conveniently severed herself from humanity by choosing a racist ethnostate that is currently, painfully obliterating the native Palestinian population. How many Western therapists have you seen actually speak about this active genocide the last 2 years that we‚Äôve all been seeing live? It‚Äôs spiritual bypassing which in this case is a green light for settler colonial violence. All Zionists have a broken soul because they pick and choose who deserves humanity and who does not. Since deleting the app, I‚Äôve needed to heal myself from what is now an eerie Zionist voice stuck in my memory. I definitely don‚Äôt recommend listening to Tamara Levitt unless you want your panic attacks soothed by a Zionist. Traumatizing, ironically.",

Stories, music, and meditations seem to have universal appeal. However, I was recently jolted awake in confusion as a new, recommended sleep story began describing the masculine features of the one our heroine was falling for, using the pronoun of this masculine character as ‚Äúshe‚Äù. It was obviously disruptive to me and not what I expected when trying to be calmed into sleep. I wonder that they chose to celebrate lgbtq+ ‚Äúpride‚Äù against all other indications of promoting general health and calm universal appeal?",

I've written in to support at least once now because it genuinely seems like there's some kind of harassment going on to try and force me to use the app more after I've taken a break due to misophonia and needing digital detoxing. The app doesn't like you taking digital detoxes. Apps that try to control my life or in any way start trying to force their way into my life get deleted, and Calm is on its way to getting deleted with the way their marketing team is handling low use.

I tend to get very overwhelmed and stressed out and that may be the reason I can‚Äôt fall asleep but with calm I can fall asleep in less than 5 minutes. I love how they have different sessions and how they keep a streak of how many sessions you do a day. The one thing I don‚Äôt like is that the stories that you can get read to you cost money, meaning that I would have to buy the higher pass which is cost money and it‚Äôs not free just to read a story. One last cool feature it has is that it will give you sessions to listen to based on your mood, so you will fill out a litter survey and it will give you the good sessions to listen to. But I would highly recommend.",

Now there is absolutely no free content on the app. Don‚Äôt even bother downloading unless you want to pay or do a free trial. I paid for a subscription for a year back in 2022, and it was helpful for me. I liked the meditation and sleep stories. I decided to cancel my subscription a year later because it was very expensive and I wasn‚Äôt using it enough. Even then, I was still able to do the daily meditations for free.  After downloading the app again today, I was very disappointed to see that there is absolutely no free content anymore. I don‚Äôt like that you are forced into an all or nothing model, especially considering how expensive it is. I wish there was at least tiered access, or that you could pay for access to just your favorite features. I‚Äôll come back to the calm app if I ever get desperate, but I am upset and disappointed that such a great app has put up such a huge pay wall.

    "title": "Review of Calm",
    "text": "Calm is a meditation, sleep, and relaxation app that varies in material, depending on what an individual wants to focus on. In general, Calm's goal is to help calm the mind and help individuals live happier and healthier lives. As a college student, dealing with stress, anxiety, and problems, sleeping is a regular occurrence. Luckily, Calm has incredibly helpful techniques in combating this. The techniques that Calm uses are grounded in real, reviewed psychological research. \n\nThis app uses mindfulness techniques such as guided meditation, breathing exercises, and soundscapes to help reduce stress. Mindfulness is ‚Äú being aware of one's experience ‚Äúat the moment‚Äù and doing so nonjudgmentally. Calm implements this through its techniques, which are connected to evidence-based approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), both of which are stated to be overall successful in helping those of all ages with anxiety, trauma, and stressor-related disorders and the top recommended techniques in combating anxiety, trauma, and stress-related disorders. Meditation and breathing techniques are two practices I found extremely helpful in managing my anxiety towards deadlines for assignments and my generalized anxiety. \n\nAnxiety is also accompanied by physical symptoms such as muscle tension, restlessness, sleep disturbance, and others. These can be combated through Calm techniques by allowing the body to go out of fight-or-flight mode and calm the nervous system. Sleep disturbance specifically is a common symptom of anxiety, as stated in the DSM-5TR; it can include difficulty falling or staying asleep and restless or unsatisfying sleep. Slowing the breath, especially with extended exhales, allows the body to relax, therefore making anxiety and physical symptoms less prominent. Overall, calm techniques are established in research and are well documented for their benefits for symptoms of anxiety.",

    "text": "In a turbulent world without many worthwhile virtual mental health apps, this app is worth it. I‚Äôm glad I have it.\n\nPros:\n\n‚Ä¢Many famous and talented people have been a part of this app‚Äîcelebrities, narrators, mental health professionals. Stories that involve fictional characters and pop culture are fun.\n\n‚Ä¢The main meditation narrators of the Calm app, Tamara, Jeff, Jay, and Mel, make me feel like I have an on-the-go support system. I love that their individual styles of meditation are different. It makes the app feel less cookie-cutter and regimented and I can feel the personalities of the people behind the narration. \n\n‚Ä¢There‚Äôs a wide selection of meditations and stories to choose from. \n\nCons:\n\n‚Ä¢It can be overwhelming at times to find the right meditation for what I‚Äôm feeling because of how big the amount of content is. \n\n‚Ä¢This app is EXPEEENSIVE.\n\n‚Ä¢I‚Äôm an audio nerd. Super low and high frequencies are jarring and make it HARDER to relax and sleep. Instruments like bells, chimes, cymbals, and sounds like birdsong and rushing water make high-frequency sounds. Instruments like basses, drums, and sounds like whale-song make low-frequency sounds. For sounds made for sleep it‚Äôs important for the audio to be de-essed. Band passes also help.\n\n‚Ä¢The app has recently added ‚ÄúInfinite Ambience‚Äù, ‚ÄúInfinite Guitar‚Äù, ‚ÄúInfinite Piano‚Äù, etc. It might be AI generated. In the spot for where the narrators‚Äô names usually go, it just says ‚ÄúCurated by Calm‚Äù. I think I remember how around a year ago, Calm had something along the lines of a ‚ÄúCustom Sleep Story Maker‚Äù that used Generative AI, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they removed that feature. \n\n‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt see some meditation and sleep techniques as equal to other ones. These ones seem a bit tacky and trend-y to me: Binaural beats, Bilateral Stimulation, EMDR, anything with Hz (hertz) in its name‚Ä¶It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to use technical sound jargon that I think most people don‚Äôt understand to make it seem fancier and more effective. \n\nThings I wish the app would add:\n\n‚Ä¢I wish when the app asks ‚ÄúHow are you feeling today?‚Äù, there‚Äôd be more variety and specificity in the emotions you can pick from.\n\n‚Ä¢I wonder if the people behind the app would add something like a ‚Äúworld map of mindfulness‚Äù, so if you want to find meditative practices/skills from one specific area of the world, or hone your meditation skills in a cultural way, you could. \n\n‚Ä¢Maybe there could be a category of meditation for physical arts and crafts? Mandala making, origami making, things that encourage creativity‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¢Dark mode, light mode, and high-contrast UI would be nice.",

I tried a meditation exercise after feeling overwhelmed and it allowed me to slow down my thoughts and feel much more present.

I recalled that some of the best sleep I ever had was when I stayed with my grandmother back in the 60s and she would read me to sleep. I thought it would be incredibly helpful. If there was some app that could read me a story and found Calm. When I first signed up there were very few stories, That‚Äôs how long ago I signed up. But that did not matter. Just the sound of a soothing voice, barely perceptible, quietly reading me to sleep was just what I needed.\nAnd now my most favorite thing to listen to at night is calm cathedral. My husband is buried in the Washington National Cathedral. My husband and I attended Tenebrae services and it is a beautiful memory so thank you. Calm has been there for me through some of the hardest times of my life and I‚Äôm so grateful that you have been there.",

    "text": "It's almost unbelievable how bad the design, interface and functionality of this app is for how popular it is and how many millions of users it has. I can't believe that the developers cannot build basic functionality into this app to do the simplest of things like create playlists and re-order items and delete things from playlists. Basic search functionality doesn't even exist. The content is decent, but the app itself literally couldn't be worse. It's almost shocking how bad it is and for an app that makes as much money and pure cash profit as they do why they can't just improve the functionality of this app to do basic things is beyond me. It's almost like they don't even wanna try. And every time they release an update to the app, they never even tell you what they've updated. It just says improvements and bug fixes. You can't even take the time to say what it is that you're improving? Because you literally improved nothing. And then you're so cheap that you won't even pay to interface with Sonos anymore. Fix your stupid app interface and give it basic functionality already!!!!",

It‚Äôs the first thing I do in the morning. Jeff Warner is an amazing teacher, Tamara Levitt as well and my new favorite - Jay Shetty. \nI use it for daily meditation, movement, help with my anxiety and panic attacks. I play bedtime stories for my kids to help them with getting a good nights sleep. It‚Äôs absolutely life changing. I‚Äôm looking forward to many more years.",
