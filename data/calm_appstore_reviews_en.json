    "content": "So I download this app because it was highly recommended by a therapist.  I originally bought a single month to month membership and then seen that there‚Äôs a family plan option that you can ONLY sign up for on the website.  So I cancelled my app membership and spent $99 for the family plan. I sent the given link to a family member and it didn‚Äôt work.  I tried to contact customer service but I received and automated response saying they would get back to me in 2-3 days.  It‚Äôs day 3, and I all I got was an email saying they‚Äôre still working on the problem. Now I don‚Äôt want any help and just want a refund.  Tried to get a refund and the website said my email wasn‚Äôt connected with any accounts.  So I once again messaged support and got the same b.s. message that it will be 2-3 for a response. What a joke!! For an app that supposed to help with anxiety, it sure did spike it!!  Stay away and find an app with better customer support!!!",

It was my favorite app until I discovered Tamara Levitt is openly Zionist. She literally follows the state of Israel on her IG. Maybe that‚Äôs unfortunately not surprising given the tech industry, not to mention Jay Shetty is a scammer who takes other people‚Äôs experiences and plagiarizes them for his social media content (also think about it - what actual monk would decide to go corporate and have an incredibly expensive and inaccessible ‚Äúschool‚Äù for coaches - scam, money grab). It creeps me out to think of all the daily meditations I had listened to with Tamara‚Äôs voice, literal years of daily dedicated listening and realizing now that she, like many Zionist therapists and meditation instructors, has conveniently severed herself from humanity by choosing a racist ethnostate that is currently, painfully obliterating the native Palestinian population. How many Western therapists have you seen actually speak about this active genocide the last 2 years that we‚Äôve all been seeing live? It‚Äôs spiritual bypassing which in this case is a green light for settler colonial violence. All Zionists have a broken soul because they pick and choose who deserves humanity and who does not. Since deleting the app, I‚Äôve needed to heal myself from what is now an eerie Zionist voice stuck in my memory. I definitely don‚Äôt recommend listening to Tamara Levitt unless you want your panic attacks soothed by a Zionist. Traumatizing, ironically.",

Many different options for calming down like soundscapes and meditations.\nWould recommend this app to: anyone who has trouble falling asleep, anxiety, relaxing, calming down, or restlessness. Or anyone who enjoys guided meditation or night/morning routine.\nCons: not a free experience!! Without purchase, there are barely any experiences available other than the soundscapes. A bit pricey for an app and extremely limited if you dont purchase premium.",

The app doesn't like you taking digital detoxes. Apps that try to control my life or in any way start trying to force their way into my life get deleted, and Calm is on its way to getting deleted with the way their marketing team is handling low use.

Now there is absolutely no free content on the app. Don‚Äôt even bother downloading unless you want to pay or do a free trial. I paid for a subscription for a year back in 2022, and it was helpful for me. I liked the meditation and sleep stories. I decided to cancel my subscription a year later because it was very expensive and I wasn‚Äôt using it enough. Even then, I was still able to do the daily meditations for free.  After downloading the app again today, I was very disappointed to see that there is absolutely no free content anymore. I don‚Äôt like that you are forced into an all or nothing model, especially considering how expensive it is. I wish there was at least tiered access, or that you could pay for access to just your favorite features. I‚Äôll come back to the calm app if I ever get desperate, but I am upset and disappointed that such a great app has put up such a huge pay wall. Especially an app that is supposed to be made to help people with their mental health.",

    "title": "Review of Calm",
    "content": "Calm is a meditation, sleep, and relaxation app that varies in material, depending on what an individual wants to focus on. In general, Calm's goal is to help calm the mind and help individuals live happier and healthier lives. As a college student, dealing with stress, anxiety, and problems, sleeping is a regular occurrence. Luckily, Calm has incredibly helpful techniques in combating this. The techniques that Calm uses are grounded in real, reviewed psychological research. \n\nThis app uses mindfulness techniques such as guided meditation, breathing exercises, and soundscapes to help reduce stress. Mindfulness is ‚Äú being aware of one's experience ‚Äúat the moment‚Äù and doing so nonjudgmentally. Calm implements this through its techniques, which are connected to evidence-based approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), both of which are stated to be overall successful in helping those of all ages with anxiety, trauma, and stressor-related disorders and the top recommended techniques in combating anxiety, trauma, and stress-related disorders. Meditation and breathing techniques are two practices I found extremely helpful in managing my anxiety towards deadlines for assignments and my generalized anxiety. \n\nAnxiety is also accompanied by physical symptoms such as muscle tension, restlessness, sleep disturbance, and others. These can be combated through Calm techniques by allowing the body to go out of fight-or-flight mode and calm the nervous system. Sleep disturbance specifically is a common symptom of anxiety, as stated in the DSM-5TR; it can include difficulty falling or staying asleep and restless or unsatisfying sleep. Slowing the breath, especially with extended exhales, allows the body to relax, therefore making anxiety and physical symptoms less prominent. Overall, calm techniques are established in research and are well documented for their benefits for symptoms of anxiety.",

    "content": "In a turbulent world without many worthwhile virtual mental health apps, this app is worth it. I‚Äôm glad I have it.\n\nPros:\n\n‚Ä¢Many famous and talented people have been a part of this app‚Äîcelebrities, narrators, mental health professionals. Stories that involve fictional characters and pop culture are fun.\n\n‚Ä¢The main meditation narrators of the Calm app, Tamara, Jeff, Jay, and Mel, make me feel like I have an on-the-go support system. I love that their individual styles of meditation are different. It makes the app feel less cookie-cutter and regimented and I can feel the personalities of the people behind the narration. \n\n‚Ä¢There‚Äôs a wide selection of meditations and stories to choose from. \n\nCons:\n\n‚Ä¢It can be overwhelming at times to find the right meditation for what I‚Äôm feeling because of how big the amount of content is. \n\n‚Ä¢This app is EXPEEENSIVE.\n\n‚Ä¢I‚Äôm an audio nerd. Super low and high frequencies are jarring and make it HARDER to relax and sleep. Instruments like bells, chimes, cymbals, and sounds like birdsong and rushing water make high-frequency sounds. Instruments like basses, drums, and sounds like whale-song make low-frequency sounds. For sounds made for sleep it‚Äôs important for the audio to be de-essed. Band passes also help.\n\n‚Ä¢The app has recently added ‚ÄúInfinite Ambience‚Äù, ‚ÄúInfinite Guitar‚Äù, ‚ÄúInfinite Piano‚Äù, etc. It might be AI generated. In the spot for where the narrators‚Äô names usually go, it just says ‚ÄúCurated by Calm‚Äù. I think I remember how around a year ago, Calm had something along the lines of a ‚ÄúCustom Sleep Story Maker‚Äù that used Generative AI, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they removed that feature. \n\n‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt see some meditation and sleep techniques as equal to other ones. These ones seem a bit tacky and trend-y to me: Binaural beats, Bilateral Stimulation, EMDR, anything with Hz (hertz) in its name‚Ä¶It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to use technical sound jargon that I think most people don‚Äôt understand to make it seem fancier and more effective. \n\nThings I wish the app would add:\n\n‚Ä¢I wish when the app asks ‚ÄúHow are you feeling today?‚Äù, there‚Äôd be more variety and specificity in the emotions you can pick from.\n\n‚Ä¢I wonder if the people behind the app would add something like a ‚Äúworld map of mindfulness‚Äù, so if you want to find meditative practices/skills from one specific area of the world, or hone your meditation skills in a cultural way, you could. \n\n‚Ä¢Maybe there could be a category of meditation for physical arts and crafts? Mandala making, origami making, things that encourage creativity‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¢Dark mode, light mode, and high-contrast UI would be nice.",

I tried a meditation exercise after feeling overwhelmed and it allowed me to slow down my thoughts and feel much more present.

I could not find it, and there was no remedy on the website, which just abandoned me after I paid so much.  I didn‚Äôt have the energy to fight about it and stopped using your website for a long time after that.  You should have been able to identify me, as you had always done, but instead, during a time when I really needed your meditations, I was shut out.  That is hard to forget, and whenever I see your paywalls, I am enraged at how you ripped me off and just dropped me during the pandemic time.  I loved Tamara Leavett‚Äôs meditations, and would like to return.  Please honor the lifetime subscription I paid for several years ago. And no, I never found any ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù‚Äîbut you did take the money from my credit card, so please honor your promise of a lifetime subscription.\n.",

That was a bust so I looked for the sounds only one sound was available and the rest you have to pay for. Everything else on the app you have to pay for except for that one sound.

I recalled that some of the best sleep I ever had was when I stayed with my grandmother back in the 60s and she would read me to sleep. I thought it would be incredibly helpful. If there was some app that could read me a story and found Calm. When I first signed up there were very few stories, That‚Äôs how long ago I signed up. But that did not matter. Just the sound of a soothing voice, barely perceptible, quietly reading me to sleep was just what I needed.\nAnd now my most favorite thing to listen to at night is calm cathedral. My husband is buried in the Washington National Cathedral. My husband and I attended Tenebrae services and it is a beautiful memory so thank you. Calm has been there for me through some of the hardest times of my life and I‚Äôm so grateful that you have been there.",

Basic search functionality doesn't even exist. The content is decent, but the app itself literally couldn't be worse. It's almost shocking how bad it is and for an app that makes as much money and pure cash profit as they do why they can't just improve the functionality of this app to do basic things is beyond me. It's almost like they don't even wanna try. And every time they release an update to the app, they never even tell you what they've updated. It just says improvements and bug fixes. You can't even take the time to say what it is that you're improving? Because you literally improved nothing. And then you're so cheap that you won't even pay to interface with Sonos anymore. Fix your stupid app interface and give it basic functionality already!!!!",

Nothing, I mean nothing had helped me until I found this app. The meditation & sleep stories are amazing. I am so grateful for this app. Now, the only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars would be due to a recommend I have for the creators, they should create a watch or something that can track your sleep & in the morning provide meditations, music, sleep stories that reflected how you slept the night before. For example, if someone woke up a lot, or of people were waking up frequently and having a hard time going back to sleep &  maybe making suggestions for  a meditation they could choose that one as more personal, or for anxiety with sleep or sleeplessness, things like that. I don‚Äôt know that would be my only recommendation, but overall and amazing app that‚Äôs worth the price.",

I‚Äôve got to say, your app was AMAZING with 15 sleep stories and 2 and 1/2 meditations, this wasn‚Äôt a problem for me because I also use headspace. Yes, they're your competition but I wasn't choosing sides. Anyways, over time you guys added feature that you really focused on for 2 weeks at a time and just gave up on it. Next, you decreased the amount of sleep stories which was ha a huge problem for me because I was NOT getting enough sleep to keep my grades up. It got so bad that I stole my mother's phone just to sleep (she Had the Premium subscription). So I was like, ‚Äùok, I'll just use headspace ONLY for sleep and calm for meditation. Then, you took away the 7 days of calm AKA: YOUR MAIN TRIAL AND ONLY TRIAL MEDITATION LEFT after you premiumfied the 7 days of something (forgot). I mean like BRU, I have other options. I started using headspace which is a great alternative if you don't have much money. I recommend bringing back some stuff from premium and reduce the price. To counteract this, put one 15 second ad at the beginning. Of every session of meditation for people without premium. Therefore, there is more than one reason to get it and it's CHEAPER. That's a win-win situation. I hope you come to the right decision. Whatever it is, I probably wouldn't stop using the app. Thank you for your time.",

    "content": "I‚Äôm a 19 y/o college student that suffers from an anxiety disorder. I feel anxious most of the time and when things to actually feel anxious about present themselves it can be absolutely debilitating for me physically and emotionally.\nHowever calm allows me to find hope in my current predicaments, and is amazing at calming me down. I really enjoy the soundscapes and meditation but my favorite thing is definitely the sleep story‚Äôs.\nListening to a bedtime story made for little kids mostly is really strangely therapeutic. There are more adult options but give the kiddy one‚Äôs a try. I feel like I‚Äôm one of the last demographics that these sleep story‚Äôs would reach but they make me feel more secure and able to connect back to the security of childhood. \nBut anyways I highly recommend this app, the subscription is a bit pricey but the quality isn‚Äôt matched anywhere else. Falling asleep, calming down, feeling secure, and gaining more confidence & hope have all been easy and peaceful to do with this app. I‚Äôve been falling asleep with my headphones on every night so I can listen to this without disturbing my roommate. But I feel like he would enjoy it too.\nAfter just the first day of the free trial I‚Äôm hooked.",

I do have one major criticism thought that I wish I could get them to pay attention to at this time.  They apps content is very limited in comparison to other similar apps.  The major area of limitation is the sleep stories section.  There are only a handful of sleep stories that can not even get you through a month of nights without having to listen to the same stories over and over again.  Many users I know are focusing in on the sleep stories section because they work.  However, all have the same complaint as I do; just not enough stories and having to listen to the same stories over and over again.  Hey for little kids, this particular flaw is fine. Heck, I have read the Fantastic Mr. Fox to my youngest literally over a 100 times to get him to sleep.  For us adults, the developers of calm need to realize we need more variety in our sleep stories.  If this app only had more, I would be elated to change my rating to 5 out of 5 stars without a days hesitation.",

    "content": "Hello, I really like the content on your app and it has really helped me to develop my practice. However because of the issues described in the title I probably will no longer subscribe to calm next year. I am blind, and use the screen reader voiceover. I can play the videos for the content well enough with play pause, fastforward but the biggest barrier I am facing is that the mountains which you tap on in the for you tab  to bring up the settings are unlabeled. I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible. Thank you for your timely consideration and namaste. I look forward to working with you in making the meditation community more inclusive.",

I love the series like 7 days of calm, 7 days of sleep, etc. the breathing exercises are so helpful. \n\nOne area for improvement would be that currently most of the meditations, especially new content, is narrated by the same woman. It would be really helpful if these same sessions were recorded with a male voice, so listeners could have an option.  It would also be helpful if there were a more diverse selection of voices throughout the meditations. (This is done in the master classes and sleep stories, but I‚Äôd like to see it in the meditations too). A second area would be a review of the content of the gratitude meditations, which make assumptions and are therefore injurious for some listeners. For example I am in the middle of fighting a long term disease. Suggestions like you should be grateful for your health are not helpful and actually harmful for me. I‚Äôd really like to cultivate more gratitude but I can‚Äôt get through any of these meditations without being triggered. A review by someone working with diverse populations could help this. \n\nOther than this, I love the app. It has been designed so well and my mental health has improved dramatically since starting to use it.

    "content": "I originally received a Calm membership for a year through Verizon and mostly knew it as a meditation app. I would probably give the meditation side of the app 3 stars. It has variety and guided options but if you are a meditator, it isn‚Äôt very helpful. The search feature also isn‚Äôt useful. I look for sound meditation with chimes at various times depending on how long I would like to meditate. And if I want a guided meditation, I want to be able to search by length, not topic. But all that being said, the sleep story side of this app is 5 stars. It has saved me from sleepless nights and eased me back to sleep when I‚Äôve woken in the night due to anxiety and illness. While I don‚Äôt use it every night, when I do, I am asleep within minutes. On nights when I‚Äôm having a hard time sleeping, one to two will ease me to sleep. There‚Äôs great variety from fiction to nonfiction, different types of narrators, and different journeys from walking through a bookstore to riding a train to taking a trip to space. I highly recommend the paid version for these sleep stories. I‚Äôve even enjoyed some of the children‚Äôs versions!",

It is so worth it to pay for the subscription, and even before I paid for the subscription (my doctor recommended the app to me not knowing I had the free version of it for about 3 years already) there was a lot of content available. I love the calendar features as well, and the check-ins are a great way for me to reflect on my day and practice gratitude. \n\nOne suggestion I have though are podcasts! I like to listen to people talking about any subject while I‚Äôm doing tasks around the house or just trying to sleep (sometimes the silence is a lot and I can‚Äôt focus on sleeping with my thoughts). If you guys made some soft spoken or any kind of podcast in which there wasn‚Äôt a lot of yelling and loud talking, I‚Äôd totally listen in.

I cannot get my mind to stop racing without something to ‚Äúdistract‚Äù it and having the many wonderful sleep stories with soothing narrators is a GODSEND that I immediately got a Premium subscription when my free trial ended. I pretty much exclusively use this app for the sleep stories because that is what is most effective for me. However, I find myself jolting awake when the sleep stories end and that is not ideal after 30-40 minutes. To combat this I started using the playlists exclusively but those are still only a few hours long, none anywhere nears 8 hours. PLEASE add a repeat button to the sleep stories so they can play on loop, or even allow the ability for us to create our own playlists out of our favorite stories! I would love that so much. Because Calm is no longer serving my needs in helping me stay asleep I have found myself using it less and less and have opted for the app ‚ÄúSlumber: calm stories & sleep‚Äù because they DO have a repeat button on their stories, as well as a whole category of long stories that last for 3+ hours. The subscription is also considerably cheaper. If this isn‚Äôt a feature added to Calm soon I will sadly have to cancel my subscription.",

The app is a little slow, which is fine, maybe it's just my iPad but if you know how to, please fix this! Ok this app is amazing! Sleep stories ALWAYS make me fall asleep! I have tried other apps, but this app is the one that gets me to fall asleep. I mainly do the sleep stories, but I've tried the mediation too and there great too! I love your music! I also love the daily check in! Best app ever! Updated feedback: I just thought of something, I don't know if you have this, but if you don't could you add the option to make playlists of your favorite calm stories, music, and meditations. You could have playlists of your favorite music that makes you fall asleep!\nUPDATE \nalright so we had a lifetime membership and then it quit so that was sad. But main thing‚Äîunless your a member or something it‚Äôs hard to use calm to its full potential. In fact, you can barely do anything. Still am firm to my claim‚Äîcalms one of the best of its kind, and is really awesome! Helpful for all! Maybe more things for non members?",

    "content": "I am a high school teacher at a high preforming high school in my area.  My students are often so stressed out and sleep deprived I feel so helpless to help them.  This year I decided to dedicate one day a week to meditating before we started class.  We do this every Thursday for the first 10-15 minutes of class. The response has been so positive from my students I am thinking of doing it two days a week next year.  The students LOVE Thursday!!  They have told me it‚Äôs the favorite part for their week.  Some students have even gotten the app for themselves.  I have heard so many times this year, ‚ÄúI needed that!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI needed to hear that today.‚Äù  After on session one of my boys said, ‚ÄúMan I was so upset about losing those 5 points on my English test and now I have let it go.  This really works.  What did you all think about?‚Äù  You know you are doing something right when teenagers open up and start talking.  Thank you for this product and allowing me the opportunity to give my students at least 15 minutes a week to destress, calm down, learn to love themselves and just breath! Can‚Äôt wait to see what the future has in store for me and my students as we take this CALM journey.",

I really relate to his presentation because he seems quintessentially California to me. I‚Äôve been meditating since I was 6 or so, brought up Vedantist Hindu, born Jewish and am now a ChristianI am an aging hippie. I meditate w my cat on my lap, I simply press my hands on her sides and she grounds me and then is the anchor; her occasionally purring. I love the pictures and the nature scenes. By the way I have been meditating every single day since November. If I might be of assistance, I‚Äôm not sure how maybe I could do a Spark or something. I wish there were Something way to dialog - I have been on the site. Maybe I could look more deeply into community of Calm. Thanks for saving my life as a process.

I drank water, started reading The Power Of Now (Eckhart Tolle), and after the introduction simply knew in that presence that I wanted to say hello to me, to consciousness, to the now.  I put down the book and played Day 2 - How to Meditate on this app I had just downloaded yesterday.   I am now finding my Homebase, through the calming inspiration narrated by Jeff Warren, and when I opened my eyes I was filled with such peace in this moment (now 5am) that tears welled up.  I embraced this expression of my self and felt pure joy.  This moment demanded a review of this app that I am grateful to invest in after my 7 day trial.  Everything else I enjoy about the logistics, user-friendly UI, and clean beauty of the app itself are all cherries on top of what I gained internally after only two days of meditating...breathing...feeling.  Thank you, developers.  I am humbly grateful for your inspirations.\n\nOn that note, my one request would be to incorporate the ability to Bluetooth or google cast the sessions and what not.  I‚Äôd love to play it through my tv when resting in bed or Bluetooth speaker when sitting by the pool!  ü•∞",

It‚Äôs like being a kid again and getting a beautiful story read to you by a soothing voice. While I use the app mainly for sleep stories I‚Äôve used the meditation, background music, and breathing exercise options on the app as well. I used to use Headspace for a lot of my meditation sessions but with Calm having so many additional features I switched over fairly quickly. \n\nThe only problem I have with this app is that I can‚Äôt set up a playlist/cue of the stories I want to fall asleep to. Sometimes I can‚Äôt fall asleep right away so I have to go through the process of unlocking my phone, setting up another story, and trying to settle down once again just to set up another story to be read. It quickly becomes irritating, especially on nights when I can‚Äôt fall asleep easily and have to go through the process of setting up an additional three stories and eventually giving up in the end. \n\nSo if that can somehow be added then it‚Äôll get my full 5 stars. But having nights where I‚Äôm on and off my phone throughout the night definitely makes me feel frustrated enough to keep it at 4 stars.",

    "content": "Ok so to start off I like it but I can barely even use anything. I was trying to do the 7 day sleep meditation but I can only do the first day and I had to repeat the first day over and over and over. All because I didn‚Äôt have the premium and the premium is $70 a year. I didn‚Äôt want to get it because that would waste my money but everything is locked for premium. So here is what I am thinking that you should do I think you should make it 50/50. Like 50% of the stuff that is locked for the premium and make it not premium so it can be fair to those who don‚Äôt have the premium and to those who have it. Now let‚Äôs talk about the price we should make it reasonable enough to get and instead of $70 let‚Äôs make it 35 dollars so it can be fair and people would be happy if they had the premium or not because they get a reasonable price and they get to use many of the meditations if they have it and if they don‚Äôt. Sorry if this was confusing but I want it to be fair because the price and the amount of meditations that you can use without the premium wasn‚Äôt fair so I wanted to make it reasonable and fair. So now I want to hear what you have to say because there are many other people that might agree with me but I am wondering if you do too",

This is what originally led me to explore other apps. They‚Äôre really beginning to expand on variety now and I don‚Äôt have to listen to that god-awful Mid-Atlantic-like accent while I‚Äôm trying to meditate or go to sleep. I love the sleep stories and my boyfriend has also grown to look forward to picking one out. One thing I noticed recently that I would like to call out to the developers was that I had turned on Jay Shetty‚Äôs sleep meditation and noticed I was able to still listen to my background music of choice from the home page. This was really really cool and something I hope I‚Äôm able to do to customize the background sounds for my other meditations. If it‚Äôs a new feature or something please continue to offer it!

The regular subscription is a bit pricy for me currently as a college student but the student discount makes helpful mindfulness tools accessible to stressed college students. The app contains incredibly helpful grounding techniques, guided meditations, and breathing exercises. With anxiety especially, sometimes the physical symptoms can worsen the psychological symptoms. It‚Äôs very beneficial to be able to focus your attention on how you‚Äôre presently feeling, how slowly you‚Äôre breathing to help calm yourself down. I really love using the check-in tools in the mornings and before bed, to track how I‚Äôve been feeling over a span of time. It makes it easier to tell my psychiatrist and therapist how I‚Äôve been feeling and for how long. I also love the sleep stories and soundscape features to help me sleep. Sometimes with my anxiety, laying in bed in silence with my thoughts keeps me awake for hours after getting ready for sleep. It‚Äôs helpful to have a relaxing neutral stimulus to focus my attention on rather than my thoughts. All in all, a very useful app with plenty of tools.",

The narrators are wonderful & plentiful so if one doesn‚Äôt cut it for you, you can change. There is also calming sounds, perfect sleep stories and A daily check in to see how you feel and offer suggestions on what might help. Their Master classes are great for learning things like mindful eating, better sleep, how to relax, and even improving your performance in life. All star narrators like Lebron James, Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu, Bindi Irwin, Bob Ross, Jerome Flynn, Leona Lewis, Jason Kidd & more read sleep stories & give advice on how to improve aspects of your life. Sabrina Carpenter & Sam Smith give music mixes to help you sleep or relax. They even have a calm body to help you wake up, warm up/cool down from your workout, reset for the afternoon and wind down for the evening. This app is for your whole body not just your mind.

There is a free app trial but you do have to pay after the trial ends but I think in my opinion it‚Äôs worth buying the app! My one recommendation though is that I think the calm app should add some more journaling to the app something more than the check ins because I think journaling is a great way to help you feel your releasing your past or just writing how happy you are if that makes sense plus if it‚Äôs not to much maybe add something to remind you to get off your phone and go outside or do some focusing hour on school work or something like that. Overall the calm app is a great app and I totally recommend if you have anxiety, or are having trouble sleeping! \n-if your reading this have a good day/night/rest of your day/night!",

This app has helped so much in getting myself into \"sleep mode\" and calming down & stopping my brain from rewinding the day or cycling through the next day's schedule. I occasionally listen to music but I mostly stick to the readings. My only request is to get Matthew McConaughey to do more readings! I have tried listening to others and they just don't work. I'd say my biggest complaint is they are all reading as though they are reading to an audience that's awake and aware. They are either too loud (even on the lowest setting) or reading with too much inflection which excites one rather than lulling one to sleep. MM knew his audience and his reading is in a very soft tone, his voice is calming and relaxing and he also seems to lower his voice as the story goes on, barely above a whisper by the end. All in all his is the perfect presentation and the only one I can fall asleep to! So please keep this story in rotation and if you can convince him to do more, please do! Otherwise I am content listening to the same story night after night.",

It‚Äôs essentially just having then skill to not let your thoughts control how you feel. Not letting your emotions get the best of you. Once you can control your impulses, you are a different person. It‚Äôs really life changing. This course starts slow and you can see real benefits after a week or so.

At the beginning, I had heard from my brother about meditation and all the benefits of it. I was half-invested, not sure if I believed all the claims (I hadn‚Äôt read any studies). So, I tried it a couple of times, but hadn‚Äôt had that meditation where it clicked yet. After a couple months though, I did some more research and started to meditate more regularly. \n\nWhile I am finally feeling more comfortable meditating alone, Calm helped guide me the entire way. There have been so many days where the messages and techniques from Calm have been extremely impactful on my life. The creators of this app did an absolutely fantastic job. And that‚Äôs not to say that the ultimate goal is to only meditate by myself. After a couple of days of mediating on my own, I love to come back to a guided session of the 21 days of calm and hear a message/lesson again. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend using Calm if you want to learn great techniques of meditation and also be inspired to improve and grow as a person.",

The app then asked me a few questions to try to determine what to recommend ‚Äî how familiar I am with meditation, how often I meditate, and what I‚Äôd like to focus on in guided meditation. It then recommended I try a one-week course on stress. I figured I would give it a try, but I did not make it 60 seconds into the very first lesson before the person leading the meditation falsely claimed that a variety of physical chronic illnesses are *caused by* stress, the same utter garbage that some people claimed to me way back when I was diagnosed over 20 years ago. I immediately stopped the course but decided to try something else before giving up on the app. I tried a few of the daily meditations, but like another recent reviewer, I found the style of the person who always leads them doesn‚Äôt really mesh with my style.

    "content": "I picked up Daily Calm after I realized my insurance had such a high mental health deductible that it would effectively never cover weekly therapy sessions. So I looked for other ways to get through a really stressful series of major life events including the death of a family member. I thought I‚Äôd try meditation. I‚Äôve been using this app to guide short mediation sessions about an average of four times a week for over a year and it‚Äôs genuinely helped me. I can honestly say I‚Äôve gained a life skill that I use every day even when the app is closed - closing my eyes and focusing on the breath for a few seconds even while I‚Äôm on the train or in a waiting room or about to go to an intense meeting at the office. This app isn‚Äôt the only way to gain that skill by any means, but it‚Äôs the one I picked up and it‚Äôs been pretty great. If you‚Äôre going through a hard time, the other things that have helped me the most with the depression and anxiety are gardening, hiking, in-person tabletop gaming, and cannabis microdosing. Crazy sounding combo, I realize, but I‚Äôm in *such* a better place than I was a year ago. Thanks for helping, Daily Calm.",

    "content": "I paid $70 for this thing, and the sleep feature does not work correctly for me at all! I set it for three hours usually, because I like the noise to continue until I know for sure that I have fallen asleep. It never fails that once it stops, it jars me out of sleep, assuming I have fallen asleep quickly enough. Unfortunately that‚Äôs exactly what keeps happening to me. I use this app on my iPad, and usually after the first song, if I am listening to sleep music, it completely stops playing, and then I get a message telling me that my timer ran out. Even though the timer underneath clearly shows that I have close to three hours still left on it. This literally happens almost every night so I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt even try to fall asleep until at least two songs have played. I like the app otherwise, but it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that I have to do that after having spent so much money on this thing!! \n\nI like the sleep stories as well, but I wish there was some way to set them on repeat because I don‚Äôt always fall asleep quickly enough and I wouldn‚Äôt mind having them play multiple times.",

The app has many different resources and techniques given to help people. It has breathing exercises which can help people who are dealing with anxiety or stress. These breathing techniques are proven effective by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. The app has calming music to listen to while doing work or to help fall asleep. For someone who is struggling with depression the app gives many tips with the focus on mental health. These tips are how to maintain a strong mental health.  I downloaded this app since I saw a lot of advertising for it. My first impressions of the app were just okay. Once I figured out how to navigate around the app and use all of the features I began to enjoy it more and more. One of my favorite features about the app is the stories to help you fall asleep. One of the parts of the app that I did not like very much is that you have to pay to get a majority of the features. Although they do have a free 7 day subscription, I feel that you need to use it longer to get a good effect from the app. Overall I think that app is pretty cool and interesting.",

Shortly after that doctor visit I found the Calm app. Its been 5 years. It had been a stressful day and there was an introduction to the app and I took the 10 minutes and did the breathing and really focused on relaxing. I went back to work and I immediately told everyone about Calm.... I have been using it ever since! The time I meditate is my time to focus, to breathe and to just be in the moment. I had horrible insomnia and started the body scans... I tried the sessions without buying the subscription but soon found that I wanted more of the sessions after I did the first; so I bought the subscription and have never regretted it once! It's been a godsend. I love the bedtime stories and the daily Calm.... there is so much on this app that has helped me. I love that the app is adding new things. Thank you Tamara and your wonderful team for sharing and helping me bring peace and calm into my life!",

You could scroll through every one simply and fluidly. now they are all separated, train stories from nature from featured or whatsoever and you have to spend your time searching through multiple tabs, that shudder as you scroll, not fluid anymore, the last thing you want to do when you‚Äôre looking to get to sleep. And though on each there‚Äôs a See All tab, you only see all of that category - making it really difficult to just access all sleep stories. And these sleep categories are all buried among daytime use tabs, meditations, daily get up and go stuff, mental fitness. Who thought this was a good idea?? The layout design is too specified and difficult to just go and find what you want. Also, while I‚Äôm glad there is more kid content being added for parents it would be nice if they added other stories at the same pace, and also backed off some of the more cheesy approaches to new stories that seems to have begin to pervade.

A nice bonus is the relaxing music that I play while I‚Äôm working to keep a peaceful vibe throughout my work day. Unlike some meditation instructions, this app does not push any agenda that is targeted toward or against any particular faith, which I know has turned some people away from meditation apps in the past.

Another thing Jeff taught me: you don‚Äôt measure how effective/useful meditation is based on how many times your mind wanders when you sit, you look at how often and how smoothly  you  find yourself applying the concepts and activating the muscles you gain from sitting. The number of times I smile and notice something in a typical day is in the dozens. This app has definitely enriched my daily experience.

When my tinnitus is bad, I use one of the sleep meditations to help overpower the sound and allow me to fall asleep. When I have a headache, I lie down and listen to a calming meditation, and the headache resolves, or at least decreases. These guided meditations really help soothe my anxiety. The different daily meditations help teach what to do for various issues, and you can save the ones you especially like.

I like that it allows me to go at my own pace, giving me the prompts to read. \nI have been looking for quite sometime for the Teacher to guide me on my personal journey of growth. I found that and more in Tamara, Jeff, Jay and Mel! Thank you, my friends! \nWith each meditation practice I become more aware, more balanced, more peaceful. I learned to step out of the whirlwind of emotions and intensity to observe them, to be curious about what makes me human, to accept it, and to let go of the thoughts and feelings that don‚Äôt serve me. \nThank you, Calm!!!!",

    "content": "I absolutely LOVE the Calm app. I recommend it to everyone in know and have even purchased gift subscriptions for three of my friends. The content it provides has truly been life changing for me. My problem lies with the app itself and its features, or lack thereof. A few key improvements could go a long way towards a smoother experience. Please figure out a way in which we can organize our favorites. I have so many that I want to refer back to. If I could separate them into categories such as focus, anxiety, etc. that would be a huge help. Perhaps a way to add a note to a particular meditation would be immensely helpful! What was that I liked about this one? Oh yeah, it‚Äôs on the topic of x, y or z. Yes, there are titles to the meditations but they don‚Äôt always fit and the descriptions are cut off so you can‚Äôt always tell from that. I spend so much time, clicking, listening a little then having to restart because it was the one I was looking for. Frustrating. There is a section for ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù but nothing ever gets put there even when I heart it and I can find zero information about it in the help and support section.",

    "content": "Do you experience any stress in your life? Or, perhaps your life is spinning out of control. Or, if not, you may find yourself somewhere in between. The Calm app does not solve life‚Äòs problems but it does help reframe them to give us a better way of living with and living through our problems. One of the greatest features is the Daily Calm which is a 10+ minute meditation. This does not mean zoning out to some strange mantra and pursuing another mystical realm! Instead, the user is guided through various styles of mindfulness. At the conclusion, guidance is given on how to approach life or reframe our issues in order to better live life rather than life dominating you. If you do choose to subscribe, there are probably hundreds of targeted series (and growing)-/ everything from sleeping better to dealing with relationships with others, dealing with loss and even dealing with yourself. Using this app consistently (I use it frequently, not daily‚ÄîI sometimes forget or get caught up in my business!) will surely help you not control your life but learn to not be controlled by your life.",

    "content": "After having calm for several months now, I‚Äôve enjoyed exploring to the variety of content from masterclasses to music to meditation. I also like the approach calm takes in encouraging you to develop your own daily practice of mindfulness. However, the main reason why I purchased calm was for the large library of meditations. However the bulk of new meditations come from the daily meditation which is always guided by the same person, Tamara Levitt. She also guides many of the meditation series they have available. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt enjoy how Tamara does her meditations and I find them more distracting than helpful. Because of this I find myself avoiding her meditations and whenever there is a choice for another voice I‚Äôll pick it, but there are only so many of these. And, if you‚Äôre not doing the daily meditations, it doesn‚Äôt take too long before you feel like you‚Äôre running out of content. Calm is great if you enjoy Tamara‚Äôs meditations, but your kind of out of a deal if you don‚Äôt. I just think its unfortunate that there isn‚Äôt more variety in the voices available and authors coming out with new content. My wish would be for calm to at least have a second choice for the voice of the daily calm.",

The length of sessions are sufficient to fully relax and recharge yet not too cumbersome to fit into a busy schedule. I come to look forward to the sessions at the end of each day as my ‚Äúme time.‚Äù  I like that there are pre-programmed sessions aimed at specific topics or goals and there are daily sessions as well.

Calm guidance was fantastic to start my new daily habit and help me sustain it. I also very frequently use sleep stories to get to sleep or get back to sleep without having to use medication. I‚Äôm extremely happy with the app overall. I have one wish though:  Now that I am enjoying longer meditation sessions, I prefer to do a guided session like Jeff Warren‚Äôs Daily Trip then continue meditating with only a sound scape. As it stands, I have to return to the app after the guided session ends and select the sound scape to continue. I would like to see a ‚ÄúPlaylist‚Äù feature that allows me to preselect multiple items in the app to play consecutively. I could then stay in my meditative state from beginning g to end.

    "content": "Two major concerns. First of all, I judge how sincere an app like this is about helping people by the availability of free content. I understand that it takes resources to produce content of this quality, but this app verges on hostile towards the non-paying user, and some people just can‚Äôt afford to pay. I saw someone saying that the master classes were available, so I looked into that - um, no. It‚Äôs the *trailers* that are available, and this sort of bait-and-switch is typical of the non-paying experience in this app.\n\nSecond, I have chronic pain, and there isn‚Äôt any content that comes up when I search for that - there apparently isn‚Äôt anything health-related at all. The one free guided meditation I found started triggering panic as it made me more aware of my pain, and I had to stop. \n\nThe upshot is that this app seems targeted towards a ‚Äúbeautiful person‚Äù demographic whose problems really will all go away if they start meditating. The series by Lama Rod Owens seems like a step in the right direction, but it‚Äôs going to take a complete reevaluation of the goals and design to really address the problem. Right now, if you‚Äôre disabled, broke, aging ungracefully, traumatized, or whatever, this app will constantly remind you that you don‚Äôt belong in the ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù space.",

Honestly I would rather have an ad after every other meditation than have all of them locked. Another suggestion I have is for if you didn‚Äôt like the first one; just have like maybe half of the meditations locked and a few of the free ones has like half of their sessions locked.

I‚Äôm trying my best to meditate, still not very good at diverting those racing thoughts but I do enjoy the short ‚Äòpep talks‚Äô at the beginning of each meditation and breathing exercises help me to unwind a little. I love the sleep stories, particularly those narrated by Alan Sklar - I never reach the end though, I‚Äôm always asleep within 10 minutes! If I wake horribly early I use the sleep meditations to try to relax back into sleep. Then there‚Äôs the music and soundscapes to explore too. I see in these reviews that some people complain about the cost but if you use the app daily, it‚Äôs really only a few cents a day. Well worth the price if you determine to make time in your day to make use of the app. All in all, I think Calm is excellent value, well designed and offers something new to explore almost every day.

There is no other app that offers the extensive tools that the Calm app offers. I love starting my day with a daily meditation, playing the beautiful, serene scenes on the background throughout my day, and concluding the day with a soundscape (such as the engine room inside of a spaceship) or a sleep story. The collaborations they have with companies like Disney and celebrities like Camila Cabello are awesome.

I was a little thrown off by having to pay over $60 right out the gate, but after giving it a try, I've now paid that fee for the last 5 years with ZERO regret. It also keeps track of how many days in a row you've meditated and the total hours.

But I find my biggest complaint and the thing that makes me go through bouts in which I stop using it altogether is the lack of variety in narrators. Tamara Levitt is used to narrate a very large number of exercises and while her voice is positive and upbeat‚Äîshe really is lovely, I‚Äôm sure!‚Äîit‚Äôs not AT ALL relaxing and totally grinds on my nerves. I literally cannot listen to any audio that she does in this app and as I said, there are many. It‚Äôs really disappointing. I‚Äôve found the male narrators, specifically Elisha Goldstein, have a slower cadence and a much more relaxing tone that allows me to decompress and stop my anxiety attacks or drift off to sleep. But repetitive listening of certain audios can lead me to memorize it, which I find has me anticipating the words rather than absorbing them. I would really appreciate more frequent updates to the ‚Äúcast‚Äù in these audios, especially ones for sleep and anxiety management.",

There is fine print in the App Store which says that Family Share does not support in-app purchases and subscriptions, but nothing in the app itself will tell you that your $70 one year subscription cannot be shared with a family member or significant other.

    "content": "This app has been incredibly helpful for me; the focused texts are simple enough to be absorbable / not distracting in a state of meditation, when you need it most. The 7 days series is excellent. The texts themselves are poignant with the exception of some cultural references Ive heard (honestly, I don‚Äôt think this is any place to mention what Amanda Palmer from Dresden Dolls thinks) - trying way too hard with that.\nMy main issue which has kept me from being able to use about 50% of the guided meditations, including Daily Calm and most other practices, is that I just can not bear the speaking voice of Tamara Levitt. I‚Äôve tried & tried and i just can‚Äôt. It it is probably just me but she really rubs me the wrong way in how mushy and drippy her voice is...it comes across as disingenuous but I realize that the intention is exactly the opposite. It would be really nice to have at least one other choice for each program - ideally the other one would be more neutral. It‚Äôs a pity because I like the content very much, but otherwise, with no adjustments of added narrators it will probably keep me from renewing my subscription.",

I mean, if you were a developer and made something that helps people, wouldn‚Äôt you want to have something in return? I think most people would agree that they wouldn‚Äôt want to make a product and have people not pay for it. Gotta pay the rent somehow. I‚Äôm still not a fan of that kind of payment system, but I‚Äôm more informed about it thanks to my dads former experience of being a computer programmer.

(Those are my favorite). I‚Äôm just giving some helpful feedback on your app..hope you use this advice and put it in an update!

    "content": "This app came into my life in the nick of time ‚Äîit helped me go through a difficult time when I was feeling very depressed about being unexpectedly laid up for a few months after a minor accident that kept me off my feet for a good three months. This app has been a godsend, for sure. Over the last 21 months, I have some favorite talks that I listen to over and over again. However, I do not like some of the voices, especially with the sleep stories. I am very particular about the modulation of the tone, and avoid those narrators that tend to be on the animated side. I listen to sleep stories to fall asleep, not to be too engaged in the story itself. But that‚Äôs just a quirk of mine as I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something for everybody. But one of the most important issues for me is that the daily calm and daily jay, I think, are too short. I am fine with guided Meditations and short doses of philosophy, but most of them run only 10-12 minutes which goes by so quickly. I wish they would make them a bit longer, say, 20 minutes or even 30.",

I used to dread laying in bed, trying to calm my mind for sleep, but now with the calm app I look forward to my sleep story and soundscape every night. However for the way I use calm there is one major shortfall in the app. There is no way to line up a queue or playlist of recordings. I will make it to the end of a sleep story, be close to sleep but not quite there and then have to search through the app again to turn on my soundscape. I know this doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal but for me who has always had trouble falling asleep it is very disruptive. It is also disruptive when I use the app to help my 10 yr old son fall asleep- I put on a sleep meditation for him, but he always wants a sleep story to follow. I either have to stay in his room through the whole meditation so I can start the sleep story, or he has to climb down from his bunk bed to do it, disrupting the calm we just established with the meditation. This app is so thoughtful in so many ways I am surprised and disappointed they have not found a solution for this yet.",

His meditations helped me as I sat waiting during my husbands medical appointments, when he was declared terminal, during the time of profound grief after he died, during the anger after I not only lost my husband but also my job of fifteen years, and during the slow spiritual journey toward healing and peace.

This app gave me the time to explore it and use it for a good week before asking for a review.

I remember when I first began I was anxious to check when I would be done. But by the end of the week, I was surprised we were done already. I'm excited about that. \n\nThe music is calming, the guidance is very calming and helpful. And it's very easy to use and I love the reminder and quotes at the end.

The ambient noise helps me to stay asleep, but I can‚Äôt find a way to have the ambient noise begin once the sleep story or meditation session ends.  It would be great to be able to make a playlist of sorts where ambient noise automatically kicks in at the end of the sleep story or meditation session. That way, if I‚Äôm already asleep or very close to it, there is no need to go back into the app to turn on ambient noise, risking the light from my phone putting back to an awaken state.  \n\nThank you, Calm!

The free edition has sufficient features for anyone curious about experiencing mindfulness, yet the add-ons are probably not a necessary.  ‚ÄúMindfulness‚Äù in itself has become a buzz word apparently coined by amateurs, and practices have mixed and matched true authentic, effective techniques to make for better marketing and adoption.

I could go on about sound quality or originality but the real thing that sets CALM apart is that they never stop making themselves better, hiring more and more celebrity pros to come in and create their own new sleep songs, narrate their own bedtime stories. What makes CALM different is that they take most of that extra money you pay for their service and immediately re-invest it in the app, snowballing it, making it better every day. The CALM app that I will have a month from now will be better than the one I enjoy today. And they‚Äôve kept this simple formula for as long as they‚Äôve been in business. It works.",

I also find it annoying that there is no apparent way to filter out kids stories, whether browsing thought the ‚Äúall sleep stories‚Äù page or in the recommended stories areas. I also occasionally find it difficult to differentiate which stories are geared towards kids unless I listen to part of the story. I love using calm, but it‚Äôs getting more difficult to justify the continued expense when it‚Äôs no longer catering to my demographic. Perhaps a separate calm kids app would be helpful.",

Even more-so after becoming a mom, which comes with a whole new set of worries for another person! I have tried through the years to get myself into a routine that includes meditation & relaxation, but always fall off track. THIS app allows me to plug in any time I want, and seek a brief meditation on a topic that I am most in need of at that moment. Whether I‚Äôm stressing over a big presentation, or having trouble with connection, the list of guided meditations is plentiful. Or I can just go solo one day (unguided) to the tranquil sounds of the scene of my choice. I also now love doing this...I open the app, choose a scene, usually a nature scene (with audio), set preference for scene to function while app is closed,  connect it to my Bluetooth speaker, and let it play while the phone is displayed right in front of me on my desk working from home. Def try the premium trial. It‚Äôs worth it to go premium.",

I used the sleep stories in those nights I had a hard time falling asleep or when I‚Äôd wake up and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep. The sleep stories were very helpful. I also started meditating 10 minutes a day. There are a wide variety of meditations even on the free version. The app also helps keep you informed on how often you are using the App. There are specialists in different fields that do informative series. I could see how I was using my skills that the App taught me to help keep myself calm and present through the day, so I subscribed for the year. This opened up even more features. You have nothing to loose by trying Calm and everything to gain.",

I also subscribe to a couple of other apps for sleep stories and meditations - one of which I pay for yearly and the other free through apple podcast. I noticed that both other apps I use (paid and free) update their content weekly and easily show the new sleep stories upon opening the app. Calm doesn‚Äôt seem to update with new sleep content nearly as often or perhaps it requires you to dig for it. Add to that, the cost of Calm is nearly double what I pay for the other sleep app I use which produces 1-3 new episodes per week. Apple Podcasts also have new free content that is updated weekly. I am nearing the end of my 1 year subscription and do not plan to renew. I do not feel the money is worth what you get from the sleep section.",

Th first thing I noticed upon downloading the app is that the home screen is soft in color and hue, and there are relaxing water noises playing. This already put me in a relaxing mood before beginning the exercise. I like that there are different meditations for different stressors (relationship problems, work, etc.) because it helps me choose one that‚Äôs best for me and helps me set intentions for the meditation. I like that the meditations do focus a lot of physical sensations such as muscle tension and breathing because I do deal with physical sensations caused by anxiety. In my abnormal psychology class, we learned about the importance of slowing down and breathing. The way breath work was incorporated into the meditation reminded me of a breathing exercise my professor taught us in class during which you hold your breath both on its way in and on its way out. Very effective in helping me take a step back from my stress and anxiety and i recommend this app!",

People don‚Äôt naturally think of it as important because our brains do it unconsciously and we don‚Äôt have to think about it. But when we stop to take a moment and breathe, we find that heart rate shifts, emotions are regulated, and perspectives change. It actually feels quite miraculous. \nAs a Christian, I know that many people are leery of (even the word) meditation. However, it is my joy to carry the message of truth regarding meditation. Meditation (ie using my own breath) has carried me through hard times and bolstered my energy when I‚Äôm weary. It is using the body and breath to be the recharge, the Gatorade, if you will,  to the soul. Even Job 33:4 says, ‚Äúthe Spirit of God has made me, the breath of the Almighty gives me life. ‚Äú  \nBreath is profound and simple all at the same time.

I decided to give meditation a try. As a busy medical student, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would have the time to make meditation a daily practice. I have made time for meditation each day since my diagnosis 2 months ago and have found it to be very helpful, especially when I am having a flare-up. It really has allowed me to break that vicious cycle of symptomatic exacerbation worsened by anxiety about my symptoms flaring up. Obviously, other lifestyle modifications (e.g. diet, exercise, sleep, and even medication) might be necessary to control and/or alleviate symptoms. I have had to make other lifestyle modifications too. Thus far, meditation has been a very effective aid in my IBS management. I highly recommend the Calm app!",

As someone who struggles with a sleep disorder, this just seems like being taken advantage of so someone can sit back and make their money. Also, with COVID-19 going on and so many people such as myself out of work, the least you could do is offer a promo, or something more enticing than 7 free days. A week is literally nothing when you have to pay a YEARLY, not monthly, subscription, especially for the price. I just don‚Äôt understand how someone‚Äôs well-being and mental health can have a price tag, much less how anyone could exploit that for their own gain. Extremely disappointed, but also not trying to change anyone‚Äôs mind.

However, part of the reason I got this app was to avoid ads and solicitations for further subscriptions. I can't seem to get this app to stop suggesting that I give a gift subscription. It shows it right on my homepage. So it tells me to take a breath, and then it inundate me with the request to give a gift. I do not see how this induces an attitude of calming. Instead I said here feeling like I should give a gift to someone that I care about in the hopes that they could find some calm in their lives, while I become irritated with the fact that I paid for an app that still has, in my opinion, ads. I wish there was a way to get rid of this feature so that I can enjoy the app that I paid for, for the purpose of that I paid for without being bothered to give a subscription to someone else.",

    "content": "Hello, I‚Äôm a 21 years old young male adult. \n\n(Jeff Warren, I think when calm sees the review they‚Äôll show it to.)\n\nI personally have to thank you, then calm of course. \n\nI was a 20 year old male living in Long Island, NY Hispanic; very normal life, ‚Äúcool kid‚Äù, stable family, with honesty a very good life I would say. But I was t happy, I was in a very bad relationship that left me suicidal, where I actually got to the point of considering it many times and even in a way attempt it. Not only that but I felt very out of my mind. I didn‚Äôt like my life, I did the 30 days session and I felt like a different individual; thank you again, this helped me understand so much about myself and who I was. It gave me awards of me, to the point that I wanted it all to change, I became very emotionally aware and left my relationship, spoke to my family about who I was, then moved to Miami with little money and now I‚Äôm much happier even though I‚Äôve been alone for a year and no sex. I can say that I‚Äôm also making much more money doing something I enjoy more, and I can say it‚Äôs changing for the better. I still have fun as now I‚Äôm 21 and I‚Äôm living in the ‚Äúnormal world‚Äù but very much self conscious about everything and every decision I make. This has helped a lot in me feeling like Im very capable in life and enjoy it so much more. Thank you again for helping people. I was lucky enough to have tried it and recommend it to everyone.",

    "content": "I like the app and have had it for a week so far and the layout is easy to navigate. The only downside is that you can‚Äôt put anything in your queue to play. For instance if you do a 15 minute mediation and want sleep sounds to play during the night, you have to go back in your phone after meditation to choose the sleep sound and manually start it. It seems counter productive to me to have to go back into your phone after a sleep meditation to play sleep sounds. If this app would allow users to put things in a queue to play more than one meditation without having to break the practice or to play a sleep sound after meditation without breaking practice by allowing users to use a queue, it would be perfect. Especially since we‚Äôre paying so much for this app and it‚Äôs not necessarily cheap. Otherwise has\ngreat features and numerous different options for a tranquil experience",

Something simple like ‚Äúhave your fav herbal tea‚Äù, ‚Äútake a 15 min walk‚Äù, ‚Äúwatch the sunrise or sunset‚Äù etc. You could have a time limit to finish the challenge and an option to post a photo as ‚Äúproof‚Äù. I think this would be a lot of fun and make it more interactive. And finally, I would love a daily journal prompt along with the others. Something thought-provoking and a little bit deeper than the other gratitude and reflection prompts. \nAgain, I love using this app and it has really changed my thought processes and put me more in tune with my emotions.

Not fighting the flow of life anymore thanks to this app. I have a committed daily practice now and I don‚Äôt ever see it going away. Now if I could ask for one thing it would be a section added for fertility. None of the other fertility meditations are seem as good as these are.

I am someone who is always analyzing everything, wakes up in the middle of the night stressed about work or bills or family things, and misses the quiet within myself. I generally have difficulty sleeping through the night. But when I commit to mediations and sleep stories, it completely does the trick. It‚Äôs unbelievable, and I was a disbeliever before a friend recommended meditation with a different app which led me to Calm. It has so many tools to calm and center me so that I can sleep, be more effective at work, be happier in relationships, and be at peace within myself.",

However, for the days when I feel like I don‚Äôt want as much instruction, or the days when I need a two minute meditation, or the days when I think a walking meditation could be fun, Calm always seems to have something. They really mastered the balance between simple and dynamic in their design. I also really appreciate the new reflection feature, which I wouldn‚Äôt take it vantage of it if they didn‚Äôt slip it so seamlessly into the daily practice. What a great idea. Anyway, this is essentially my daily gratitude for the app itself because it‚Äôs been there for me through thick and thin and I recommend for anyone looking for some support in pausing :)",

I tried the free version for a few weeks and loved it, so I went ahead and purchased it, and haven't looked back. I usually do the daily meditation in the morning and one of the program meditations at night, followed by a sleep story. While I still feel that I am not sure I am any better at meditating, I do feel more at peace and calmer.\n\nI do wish for 2 things for this app: 1, that they tell you or give you an idea of what to do with your mind's eye once you close your eyes. For me, it is worse than my thoughts. But my husband and I came up with 2 different \"views\" (i.e. a meadow near a brook with dandelions to put my thoughts on and \"blow\" them away during my next breath - the visual of seeing them float away helps put them to rest). Now that I can focus on that I can focus easier on the breath.\n\nAnd the 2nd thing I wish this app offered was a dairy of some sort. At the end of each session, you ask how it was, but I want to also comment on how I was - was I distracted, or did I feel that I improved. Being able to see the progress helps the progress along. It also would be a good thing to look back over and see if certain lessons need to be re-explored.\n\nBut even without those, I think the app is great and have enjoyed using it.",

When I purchased it something happened and they charged me twice for the app.  There wasn‚Äôt a way to contact them so I asked my credit card company to reverse the charges and they did.  Coincidentally at almost the exact time that the charge was reversed my app started performing horribly - it started killing my battery, literally to zero, after only playing 1 story.  For example, reviewing the battery usage indicator on my iPhone 10 says I‚Äôve used the app for 1 hour and used over 80% of my battery.  I have restarted my phone numerous times, loaded all the Calm updates, and have reported the issue to them via their help center.  I don‚Äôt believe in coincidences - I haven‚Äôt seen any reviews here that indicate this is an issue with anyone else.  This app developer must be a rouge programmer in his/her garage - scary stuff.  I‚Äôm going to get another refund if this performance problem doesn‚Äôt magically disappear.  And then I‚Äôm going to develop an app just like this to sell for a much cheaper price and compete with this product.  Shame on the price they charge for this app - that I have read in the reviews.",

This is amazing. It‚Äôs so nice. Relax you so much. It‚Äôs not just for sleeping depression when you‚Äôre having a bad day sleeping in the morning and also about just having fun. It‚Äôs really fun to have this app I suggest for you to get it if you can‚Äôt fall asleep it is so good. I love it. It‚Äôs the best it‚Äôs just so nice and if you like thunderstorms, how about you get this app it‚Äôs the best thing in the world. I think it‚Äôs just so nice because my mom loves it. I love it.

I also use various music options for different times of the day and moods I‚Äôm in. There are new features added to the app on a regular basis so I know I‚Äôll never run out of fresh content. I have yet to try Daily Movement (Yoga and stretching). And the app has more to offer. I find myself recommending Calm App to everyone for a lot of different reasons. And as a subscriber I can gift 30days of free app usage to anyone interested in trying it out. A very cool feature!",

When I decided to try Calm, I was a bit skeptical because I had tried so many different apps, skills, and techniques in the past, and NOTHING worked. I was still up for HOURS at a time each and every night, and waking up with 5-6 hours of sleep each and every morning. When I downloaded Calm, I did not have the membership. I was a bit disappointed with how little I could do, and how expensive the membership was. But the investment was worth it! The sleep stories and meditations have me asleep in 30 minutes TOPS (with the help of some anti-anxiety and sleep pills). I also have depression and anxiety, and the guided meditations are amazing! Every morning, I stretch with the guided stretches, and I do the Daily Calm and check-ins each day. No matter how dedicated to mindfulness and meditation you would like to be, this app is worth your time and money. I feel so much happier and more well-rested. I give an 11/10!",

Calm now has masterclasses (which I intend to try soon!), meditations geared towards kids, and even bedtime stories, for those of us whose busy minds need a calm voice to lull us to sleep still. The calming bedtime sessions have helped me on numerous evenings when I thought I was going to be up way past my bedtime with insomnia. Instead, I quietly listened to someone reading a story, with tranquil ambient sounds, and was asleep minutes later. Give Calm a try, you have nothing to lose!

The timed, unguided sessions are great once you know what you want to focus on. Sleep Stories include fiction and non-fiction read by a wide variety of people. There are tales in, what are to me, second languages, and they are amazing too! There's also music and ambient sounds with music. The most recent addition is 'Music' - this has 'Focus', 'Calm/Relax', 'Deep Sleep' and they seem to be different tones and patterns/wavelengths to help with those activities.

I use the  playlist during my yoga/stretching after a work out to calm down and relax and I‚Äôm obsessed!!  So highly recommend bc of the content! 5/5 stars! I gave it a 3 though over all bc it‚Äôs a very slow app. I‚Äôll have full service every and other app works great on my phone but the loading time with Calm App is so slow  compared to other apps on my phone..sometime I‚Äôll just end up turning it off bc it never loads no matter the WiFi or LTE I‚Äôm on... now idk if it‚Äôs my service or the app sometimes.

The reminders and daily practices help one to establish healthy daily routines and habits that have the potential to improve the quality of mental health and its frequency and duration. And these are my positive first impressions of the APP ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù after a brief 15-20 minute experience using it for the first time! I am looking forward to exploring more of its features and using them on a daily basis. I recommend that therapists and life coaches introduce this APP to their clients especially with those clients that are anxious, stressed, or angry. Well done to the developers of ‚ÄúCalm,‚Äù you have created a professional mental health APP that will improve the mental health, happiness, and peace of its habitual users!",

I use silence as my alarm on another app and it works splendidly, and is not nerve wracking, like an alarm would be.\n\nHowever, after years of satisfaction, an noticeable issue has come to my attention: More and more of the sleep stories are of a religious nature. At first the sleep stories were fantastic: funny stories, fairie tales, travelogues, poetry, even some to BORE you to sleep, like someone reading the rules of cricket! LOL \n\nBut, for some reason, writings are containing more and more religious content and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm in a class on Religions of the World, when I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep. This falls into the category of ‚Äúpersuasive rhetoric ‚Äú and my brain is busy analyzing my own opinion s on the theology or philosophy that is presented, keeping me from resting. \n\nCould we please just have stories that our brains will not be analyzing for truth?",

I was very disappointed to find out that our 1 year subscription could not be shared. It basically makes the ‚Äúfamily sharing‚Äù pointless. My question to the developer is, will it really hurt your business that much to allow family members to share one subscription? I‚Äôve had this for over a year and this is the first time I‚Äôve even tried to share it with someone in my family list. It is not a cheap subscription but if it is going to hurt your business, then limit it to x amount of shares or offer the second subscription for a discount. Just a few thoughts. Otherwise.

It used to be really hard for me to fall asleep because my mind would constantly be thinking (unless I was extremely exhausted), and have the calm app to thank. There are so many sleep stories to choose from by several different narrators so you can find your favorites. They update with new stories regularly, which is awesome. They also have a calm kids section which helps our little ones to fall asleep before the story is over! We also enjoy the daily meditations. I can‚Äôt say enough good things and always recommend this app to everyone. It‚Äôs so relaxing. Thank you!! Keep being amazing!! Definitely worth the money too, especially the lifetime rate with the 60% discount!!",

I don‚Äôt care to go through every album to count how many are available, but it‚Äôs pathetic that it requires extensive searching to find one. \nI even re-downloaded the when I was coming to write a review the first time because there were reviews shaming other reviews for ‚Äúnot looking hard enough‚Äù for the unlocked content. I‚Äôm now convinced that those reviews were forged by the developers, or they were looking for something other than a sleep app. \nWhen you start the app and go to the home page, it presents a variety of different tracks - and every one of the was locked but a motivational talk by LeBron James. At this point, I‚Äôm just typing to be typing; this app is a joke, I have no intentions of paying $70 a YEAR (not by months?) for an app that won‚Äôt let me preview what I‚Äôm getting. \n^Yeah, I could do the 1 week trial, but if I don‚Äôt cancel in time then I‚Äôm out $70 üëéüëéüëéüëé",

    "content": "What I‚Äôve observed is motivation works differently for different people. Watching daily motivation quotes can work for someone, while watching some leader‚Äôs videos can do for some. But during all these media consumption phase we all are neglecting to care about what our brains want to tell us. We can only listen to our brains when we give attention to our thoughts. What do we think? how often are we getting distracted? how we cant even keep simple counts of breath as we breath as we are taken away with random thoughts. This can be realized as you spend quality time with yourself in a meditative state. I installed Calm with a bit of skepticism in mind that how can another media on a device help me not get distracted. But looks like it guides you well enough to have you introspect yourself, motivate you and gives a moment of self realization which you will definitely feel missed as you discover it. Great work team Calm!",

I tried my usual solo breathing & meditation techniques but they‚Äôre just not As effective as it used to be. I then started looking for meditation apps and thought I‚Äôd give this a try. SO glad I did! They have several categories from anxiety & stress relief to sleep aid sessions. All so very soothing, relaxing and 100% effective-I‚Äôm hooked! Also, I used to listen to gentle water or instrumental sounds to help me fall asleep but this app works so much better & faster.

While the sleep meditations work for me, I find the sleep stories with celebrity narration too distracting and gimmicky to fall asleep to, but I know others users for whom this is their favorite feature. Calm offers a series of sequential programs for mindfulness skill-building: ‚Äú7 Days of ______,‚Äù where the next day‚Äôs content unlocks with the completion of the previous day‚Äôs. As a paying user, I wish there were a way to override this. I once exited a minute early, when the wrap-up was nearly over, because I had to leave, and the app made me redo that day to access the next meditation. Similarly, I just updated versions and lost three days‚Äô progress in a program. I think the only way to catch up is to let them play out with the volume off, which is a waste of time and energy.",

But now all of that is gone, the ‚Äúplace‚Äù I went is gone, and the app is just another cluttered, stressful place of mental noise. Calm has added fragmented journaling options, which I guess is nice for any who wish them, but I will not trust my thoughts to their app, because that is essentially what it would be. Unlike Day One, they have no export feature or backups, and these recent events have not exactly made me trust them. A lot of materials are gone as well, though I can‚Äôt be sure of what all of it was. My arthritic thumbs don‚Äôt appreciate the new side-swiping menus for the sleep stories either.

Then after, I kept with the practice prior to sleep, as I often stayed awake with racing thoughts. The Sleep Stories and meditations offered knocked me out every time. Still later, I really began practicing meditation during the day with the Daily Calms and other sessions. These have probably been the most valuable to my daily life. Much of the exhaustion I was experiencing that I thought was due to lack of sleep I believe now was due more to stress. Repeated practice of mindfulness has increased my calm, my awareness, my clarity, and my happiness. The guided lessons are akin to cognitive behavioral therapy, very poignant and always kind. There is no wrong way to practice this. There is no failing. There is no order that must be followed or schedule adhered to. There is only the benefit of the more you use it, the better you feel.",

I‚Äôm not going to say it‚Äôs a cure because there is no such thing. I view it as a tool to maintain your mental fitness like a treadmill and exercise helps maintain your physical fitness. Gradually over time your mind becomes stronger and more capable but mindfulness like physical exercise should become part of your routine so you can keep optimum mental fitness. Also, I was on medication and no longer require it yet it doesn‚Äôt mean anyone should stop taking their medication. I suggest to start doing mindfulness and as you progress there may be a reduction to your prescription and eventually you may be able to come off of them. Hope this is helpful! God bless!",

I also love access to albums such as ‚ÄúTransfigurations‚Äù by Moses Sumney.\n\nWhat I don‚Äôt like in general is that ‚Äúcalm‚Äù is the only ‚Äúpositive‚Äù emotion available under the ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù Check-In feature.\n\nAs though if I‚Äôm not feeling calm, I must be experiencing adverse conditions. I see the marketing thing they‚Äôre doing with ‚Äúcalm‚Äù as a positive emotion, however I think it would be helpful to include one or two other emotions such as ‚Äúexcited‚Äù and ‚Äújoyful‚Äù, or something like that. \n\nAlso, in my opinion, the free version is definitely not worth having at all in comparison to some other apps which offer a handful of helpful free options, and a wealth of options once you subscribe.\n\nI understand it‚Äôs a business that offers a wide variety of helpful features with popular (and probably expensive) celebrities and professionals though, so I‚Äôm sure they have to pay for that in addition to their employees.\n\nAll in all it‚Äôs a cool app if you decide it‚Äôs worth paying for.

You can even have them play for as long as you want. There are meditations and breathing exercises that are worth listening to. There are also sleep stories that are good for kids that struggle falling asleep. This app is for all kinds of people, I think anyone would be able to find something on this app that helps them in one way or another. They even have sounds for babies and pets! It is so, so, easy to navigate and it has truly helped me have a peaceful nights sleep.",

    "content": "As we all know, stress is a major contributing factor to many health related ailments. I love this app because it provides me with invaluable tools for managing and lowering my stress levels.  The Breathing exercises contained within were game changers for me.  Of course I‚Äôve known about breathing exercises before, but this was different.  Immediately while doing my first breathing exercise, my sustained breaths felt like I was chanting a mantra as they drew in and out of my body slowly; steadily; rhythmically.  Set to a chorus of Himalayan sounding bowls, one can still hear the gentle yet haunting tune long after the session is over. In fact, I can, in a moment of solitude, draw upon the soundtrack within my mind and have a breathing session anytime and anywhere I desire.  All thanks to Calm.  If you don‚Äôt already have the app, get it!  Your mind, body and soul will thank you for it.",

I have been a subscriber for YEARS and up until now I‚Äôve been ok with the price increases because I use this app more than any other, HOWEVER now that they‚Äôve taken away family share, I will reconsider. I am not CALM about being charged more for less. Apparently leadership at Calm has lost sight of their original core values and succumbed to the ilk of Silicon Valley greed.  I will begin my review of other options and likely not renew. \n\nSadly, here was my last review‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôve been a Calm customer for several years and I love it! My Calm app is with me throughout the day. I start my day with the Daily Meditation (and days that I don‚Äôt, I find I‚Äôm not as positive and prepared to face challenges), I listen to the music options while I work, and often end my day with a Sleep Story. As an entrepreneur, working to get a start up business off the ground, its important for me to find ways to keep myself grounded, and some days, my Calm app is the only thing helping me do that.",

What if you added a feature which allowed a loop? So that you could have an additional warning bell for those who meditate for hours at a time. I would personally really appreciate this option because I sometimes need an external reminder to come back to my body, \n(But it would be sad if this comes out as a feature only for Premium users because your monthly price is a little steep for me and I would really only use this feature)",

I needed something to keep me focused on my meditation.  \n\nInitially, I struggled a bit with the voice of the person guiding the session, but once I got used to hearing her, it was much easier.  Other people and other stories and classes sounded different. \n\nI use the daily calm almost every day. the lessons in the meditation so often are reinforcing what I‚Äôm learning and hearing in another part of my life.  Very useful quotes at the end to remind me what the lesson was about.  Often I will screenshot the quote and picture and share it with friends.  \n\nI love the variety of sounds I can select and how there is a visual with each.  \n\nI recently listened to the Breaking Bad Habits addiction class and really felt as though I was at a seminar for psychologists and neuroscientists.  It was amazing what I learned.  I have a daughter who is a neuroscience and psych major in college. I had to share it with her.  \n\nI‚Äôve also been stepping through the various meditations on self care, relationships, etc and those also have been enormously helpful.  \n\nSometimes my daughter can‚Äôt sleep so she listens to the stories on there.  I love that there are classics mixed in with new ones I had never heard of. \n\nBest $60 bucks I‚Äôve ever spent on an app like this.  Thank you, Calm.",

I‚Äôve taken breaks here and there to use other apps when the content starts to repeat itself but other than that still love it. \n\nOne feature I would love to see added at some point is being able to adjust the duration of more meditations.

And so, reluctant to seek emotional help because it‚Äôs such a personal issue, I turned to this app. And because I don‚Äôt have the means to purchase the app I have no access to their help. There is such a refreshing trend of prioritizing mental health in this age. But that‚Äôs half of the battle to actually helping people. I‚Äôm sure this app has good intentions but there will be no change in the epidemic of mental health issues so long as help is unattainable for ALL people who need it, not just those that can pay. If I had the means, I‚Äôd pay for a therapist. But those who lack the means to meet with someone are also left behind in such an accessible app that has such capability to make a difference. So my review: I feel very hungry for the help that this app offers and I feel truly left behind. I am sorry for the many others who I‚Äôm sure have come here searching for help, as I did, only to find help (once more) unattainable. Do we care about actually helping people? Or do we care only about hooking people?",

I paid for the year, so wanted to be able to use the app. Though, I don‚Äôt relish the idea of ruining  my phone in the process. I never noticed previously when my case was on the phone, but it hurt my hand how hot it became.

For example, yesterday's was about Practice... I'm a classical musician, and practice is a necessary evil, however I didn't get to meditate until it was too late, and it was no longer accessible. \n\nAlso, why not make the daily calm a part of a larger accessible archive for subscribers, so that one may focus on a particular issue that needs work or focus, vs just a small selection of a few daily calms.

Their custom playlists that do auto play are only about 5 hours so if I did wake up in the middle of the night, chances are the playlist would be over and I'd have to look at my phone to start another meditation. I am BEYOND ecstatic that we can finally create playlists that auto play the meditations within them.

I liked the fact every time I went into the app that they asked how I was doing. Within this app they have many mediation options to calm anxiety. The first day there is a 3-minute mediation, the second day it is 5 minutes, the third day it is 10 minutes, and the time increases by 5 every day until on the seventh day the time is 30 minutes. This app is a good app to treat generalized anxiety disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is an excessive form of anxiety and can be followed by uncountable physical symptoms like muscle tension, restlessness being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, etc. This app is a great way to reduce anxiety because the mediation that occurs throughout the seven days helped me feel more relaxed and I did not have as much tension as I normally do.",

I've emailed them twice to request more stories. The response has been that stories are added every week. But this is not true. It rotates between additions of sleep music, meditations and stories. So in truth, about one to two a month are added. \nIf you have as big a problem as I do sleeping then the repitition of the same stories over and over becomes less effective. \nI've looked everywhere else for more stories but Calm is still the best for stories. I just wish they focused as much on the stories as they do on meditation. \n\nI have serious trouble sleeping, and the Calm sleep stories are a big help for me. I can listen to them and focus on the reader and my mind won't wander off like it always does to a million other things. Before I know it I'm asleepüòä",

I‚Äôve learned that this little time I spend here enables me to connect with myself in ways I never imagined, bringing me peace of mind and a mindfulness that serves me throughout the day. Also, being a guided practice, the guide is soft, pleasant and trustworthy. I reflect time and time again throughout my day on the topic and what it makes me feel, adjusting as possible. I appreciate this time because I am transcending my beliefs and am feeling better each time noticeably. Thank you for being my guide. Knowing that I can tap into the resources over the day with Jay, Jeff, and still have a little movement with May enriches my tranquility for when I feel I want to go there. I love you for the practice imparted on me. Happy Monday!",

Calm customizes your recommendations based on how you are feeling that day and what you want to get out of the app. It has stuff for the whole family including a kids section.  You do have to pay $70 a year for premium, however that‚Äôs only a little less than $6 per month. My family compared it to being less than Netflix. The price is totally worth it for all the features it comes with. I would definitely recommend  this app to anyone with anxiety or anyone who just needs to make time in their day for mindfulness.",

I appreciate the new additions to the app in the daily section, I love the sleep stories, sound scapes and guided the meditations are wonderful. One thing I would love to see brought to the platform are more options for advancing my meditation practice- something like a little less guidance and longer than 10-12 minutes.

It‚Äôs because of his 30 day course that I‚Äôve finally established a meditation practice after years of sincere attempts. His approach is very human and relatable; I find sessions with his recordings much more fruitful since he sandwiches the nuggets of clarity between quiet moments. I‚Äôm able to ease into the session, instead of being urged into quietness then being lectured by Tamara..maybe that works for other people but it‚Äôs inaccessible to me. \n\nI also use the children‚Äôs meditations with my five year old daughter and the sleep stories when she‚Äôs having a hard time sleeping. I‚Äôm glad to share this experience and skill with her. I was fortunate to have an elementary school teacher show me how powerful meditation and journaling was at an early age, but didn‚Äôt have a way to reintroduce it into my adult life AND share it with my daughter till now. \n\nI used Insight Timer for awhile but was overwhelmed by the features and endless options.

I asked if they could make them little bit larger for  those of us who cannot see well at night without reading glasses. They never responded, in fact with in a few weeks they made the reading icons even more difficult to read.\n\nBeing a neuroscientist I recommended this app to my patients. Many of them complained of this difficulty and so I once again wrote a support ticket. They Never responded.\nThey also changed the voice of the Female narrator for the meditations and put a background noise which is constant. This may be easy for some people to hear her voice without difficulty But I find it impossible. Background sound rushing water perhaps like Niagara Falls. Very difficult to concentrate and hear her voice clearly.  I am a 20+ year veteran meditator and find this new sound agitating \nI explained it was difficult and asked if they would turn the volume down.

Cannot express how easy it is to fall asleep listening to this app. When she first started the app at night my thought was ‚ÄúYeah right‚Äù I‚Äôm going to listen to silly music and drift into dream land. After the first week I was sold. There are many Calm stories we have started off in listening in bed and sometimes takes several tries to stay awake to hear the end of it. Our recent story is with Keith Morrison that took 4 times to get to the end. The storyline is about Goldie Locks and how portage goes missing and a bed is slept in - this is a story where I wanted to laugh many times during his reading yet I didn‚Äôt want to wake up my wife. This is one of my favorite stories to date. He applies his investigation methods to the story as he does on Dateline - this is great!",

    "content": "Amazing app. I use sleep stories every single night and my toddler uses the kids sleep stories at nap time. It‚Äôs so relaxing! I am actually excited to jump into bed at night because I get to listen to a story! I also use the ten minute daily calm meditations all the time! There is so much value in this one app- sleep stories, daily journaling, meditation, breathing exercises, and more! My one suggestion is to add more emotions to the daily check-ins. Most of the time I‚Äôm feeling an emotion and it‚Äôs not one of the choices. So I just have to pick one and make it work. For example, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúfrustrated,‚Äù ‚Äúguilty,‚Äù ‚Äúoverwhelmed,‚Äù ‚Äúsurprised,‚Äù ‚Äúshocked,‚Äù or ‚Äúcurious,‚Äù etc. I wish there were more emotion choices to better describe how I‚Äôm feeling. Otherwise, everything else is perfect! I love this app and I tell everyone I can about it. I would gladly pay $100/year for this app.",

My daughter loves it to help her sleep and the guided meditation. She now is a very enlightened, leveled out ten year old and the meditation helps now with her hormonal and menstrual transition.  I have to say everyone can benefit highly from it. The free demo is great to get your feet started and see how it helps before if you feel some doubt, but I doubt you will have any after you try it!

I love this app bc there‚Äôs many options and genres of things to listen too, they all have calming voices and is interesting enough to keep my mind occupied but not keep me awake.

I don‚Äôt think it should even be labeled free in the App Store if you can‚Äôt even use it in the slightest. I was given the impression that even if there are in app purchases they at least have a lot of unlocked things to play, and then you pay more if it really benefits you and you‚Äôre interested in all the other things. That is usually how apps labeled free work. I would like to have a peaceful night sleep but I need to find something else.

Til now I could not find how to stop the sound unless I quit the app .  \nThe app does not recognize that I paid for my subscription and keep on trying to sell me the product. It does not know  that  I am good to go and can use it . No , no no no , how can they figure out a way to torture you so they  will not let you get away that easy. You have to use a number of steps supposedly giving you choices , but they miss the point of simplifying its operation and   for me they succeeded to create a new level of stress I did not had before using the app. \nSo for now, this app is a a good source of frustration and agitation .

I guess you could call it a living app. Anyhow, at the times I needed it, the meditations and breathing helped me feel less alone and got me through those few years. \nNow, I‚Äôll sometimes use one of the sleep stories to distract my mind when I‚Äôm thinking too much. I usually fall asleep long before the story ends no matter how interesting it is to me.  Darn! How did that story end? The next night I fast forward to the last I remember of it. Often that‚Äôs less than 5 minutes into the 30 minute story! One story can last me a few nights. LOL.  \nAnother that I like to use is the 15 minute Ocean soundscape to relax me and lull me to sleep. \nThere is so much more in the Calm app that I enjoy, and it keeps growing. \nThank you, Calm!",

    "content": "I got this app to help me fall asleep, and all it does is frustrate me. I really wish I hadn‚Äôt paid for a full year‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to listen to 45 minutes of a sleep story when I‚Äôm going to sleep. I only need 15. After that, the story wakes me up. I don‚Äôt understand why this app has made sleep timers so difficult. You can set a timer to make the app go to sleep after a certain amount of time just playing the background sound, but it will still play the whole story. The only way to actually get a sleep timer is to play a story from a playlist, but I haven‚Äôt had that work consistently. Also, why can‚Äôt the app keep track of where I left off in a story or playlist? If you navigate away, it has no idea where you were. Which is extremely annoying for the playlists because if you want to use the timer, you have to restart them, otherwise they are treated as a single story with no sleep timer. I really thought this app would be better designed for sleep‚Ä¶ very disappointing.",

The subject of mindful meditation, mental health, etc. is no longer taboo and on the rise and people of all incomes need resources available to them.

And I am not a newbie to meditation with my Indian culture and Hindu upbringing in America, I have learned a lot about pranayama. But this calm app offered something different, which has been amazing at allowing my mind to rest. My depression experiences has likely cost me over $500,000 in opportunity cost.

Admittedly the last couple years I haven‚Äôt used it as much, but when I did, I really appreciated it and found it helpful. \nHowever. \nI just saw that there is, or will shortly be, a new sleep story using AI technology to have Jimmy Stewart narrate it. Regardless of the fact that his estate/family consented, I find it insidious and irresponsible of Calm to endorse the use of AI to make money off a person after they are dead. It‚Äôs ethically gray at best, exploitative and sinister at worst. Personally, I would not be calmed, soothed, etc. by listening to the AI-generated voice of a dead actor, but hey, that‚Äôs just me. \nAnyways ‚Äî Calm will never get another dime from me, nor will I ever use the app again; I canceled my subscription and deleted it today.

Our body‚Äôs sympathetic system spikes when we run into danger. When we feel anxiety our body does the same. Calm music helps to increase our parasympathetic response which allows us to calm down.

    "content": "From the get go, I love that it doesn't make you create an account to use it. There are lots of nice nature sounds available with visuals for free and I really appreciate that they will keep playing when I use another app or lock my phone (a setting you can turn off). I also like that the nature sounds starts playing upon opening, the ease of swiping to different sounds, and that I pick what sounds pop up on my screen. I have just been using that feature for a while and have just decided to give their guided meditations a shot. It doesn't seem like they have as many free guided meditations as Simple Habit, but they seem to cover the topics I want, and I'm partial to simple nature sounds anyway. Even when I don't want to meditate it makes wonderful background noise. Really appreciate it.",

    "content": "This is a well thought out application for meditation and has strong anchors in psychology..  As a psychologist I weekly recommend this app to my patients to use to quell and address anxiety and sleep issues.  The research is sound and the principals realistically discuss that facing and accepting anxiety (however paradioical) works!  I like how the app states to accept the thought and to let it float on by.  Awareness is a strong tool in strengthening our self esteem.  Self care makes us stronger and more compassionate individuals where we can give back and support our families, friends and communities.  This is positive psychology in its truest form.  Keep up the good work.  Now for more programs for kids and teens.   And perhaps setting up meditation centers in schools.  Excellent and well thought out.  Thanks for all of your hard work",

I‚Äôve read the reviews from people with free trials, and I doubt I‚Äôd buy it, seeing just what they‚Äôre seeing. Here‚Äôs what I like about it so far: The ‚ÄúHow to Meditate‚Äù series by Jeff Warren, the  ‚ÄúRadical Self Care‚Äù series by Lama Rod Owens, a few of the Sleep Stories,‚Ä¶\n\nHere‚Äôs where I‚Äôd suggest improvements: I just had to look up the names and titles of these, which I‚Äôd bookmarked as favorites so I could find them. The organization could use some improvement. I‚Äôd suggest sorting things by what you want to DO (e.g., movement, meditation [by type]), etc. \n\nAlso, I recently lost a loved one. When I searched for ‚Äúgrief‚Äù, ‚Äúgrieving‚Äù, ‚Äúloss‚Äù, etc,. It returned exactly two meditations, both by the same person. I think there‚Äôs a real need for more in-depth topics, based on the other reviews I‚Äôve read.  And if you can‚Äôt make this app free, I‚Äôd suggest creating a ‚Äúfree-will donation‚Äù feature for those with means to help people who can‚Äôt afford this app but who also really need something like this. I‚Äôd be willing to contribute a few bucks to help a struggling student or senior, or anyone. \n\nJust some thoughts off the top of my head. Thanks.",

If you are in CBT (and definitely if you are in DBT), this will greatly help you overcome negative thought patterns.\n\nFor beginners, do the 7 days of calm.  Then do the 21 days of calm.  If you need, repeat the 21 days of calm. This will train you with the ability of basic meditation.  If you commit to improving your mental and spiritual health.  \n\nFinal advice, don‚Äôt buy the app right away.  If you wait, you will get an email for 40% off an annual membership.

The choices were overwhelming, not laid out in any pattern I could see, and some didn‚Äôt seem on topic (‚ÄúGet Energized,‚Äù for example). It‚Äôs the same for all the other sections; a presentation that makes decisions difficult and puts barriers between Calm‚Äôs users and Calm‚Äôs amazing content.

It‚Äôs clearly intended to surface sessions users might not have found on their own. Those design decisions themselves seem to acknowledge the app bloat, and are trying to help.

    "content": "From the moment of my first meditation session I‚Äôve been hooked! I have Tourette Syndrome so my mind is constantly stressed and on high-alert. However, I found that during mediating, my motor tics vanished! I admit, I had my doubts about this app. I‚Äôm usually not too good at mediating and it sometimes brought me more stress than relaxation. But the narrator walks you through it and keeps you focused and calm. It‚Äôs like you step outside of your body and go to a sort of spiritual place. You won‚Äôt believe it until you try it and I highly recommend that you do! \n\nGreat for stress, trouble sleeping, sadness, reducing stress from  Tourette Syndrome (and things alike), etc. Basically, if you‚Äôre feeling down, angry, stressed, guilty, grief, lost, or overall just not good‚Äîthen this app is definitely for you!",

It is so easy to quickly feel overwhelmed,!stressed out and frazzled in today‚Äôs technological minute to minute incessant barrage of information. Our world has become bombarded with uninvited interruptions as if this is the norm. \nThe calm helps one to return to that peaceful, blissful place that is so necessary and reminds us that space and peace and calmness are some of the keys to obtaining an inward fulfilling place. The inner space that regulates our interaction with those things outside of us that demand our consciousness whether invited or not. The calm helps us stay in touch with that divine inner spirituality that can be considered a regulator of sorts that provides a strong boundary for successful containment of the the things we choose to be important !",

So I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù\nThis app is wonderful. There are sessions for beginners that are a great introduction to the practice. I used the app for two weeks before deciding to upgrade. It‚Äôs 100% worth the steep price. You can choose from a wide variety of background music or nature sounds to play during your session, or choose silence. The sessions run from fully guided to no guide. You can set a timer. You can just do breathing exercises. As someone with anxiety and depression, I absolutely love the courses on gratitude and self-worth. I have definitely noticed a difference in my ability to handle stress and calm myself in hectic moments. I have recommended this app to all my friends and coworkers.",

It got to the point that I couldn‚Äôt stand to open the app. I have no interest in paying $100 a year for more unavoidable notifications. I hope the developers take this feedback into account.

I can only listen to 1 story if I don‚Äôt pay for the premium version, and every other category options are just the same amount of limited. I was going to give this 3 stars for the regular version and not the premium version, but after further exploration on the app, I found myself even more disappointed with how many options I DONT have because I didn‚Äôt pay for premium.

I have had calm for almost two years now and decided to finally write a review since it‚Äôs so good. Everything about calm makes you feel like everything‚Äôs going to be okay and that your also being wrapped up in a warm hug!\n\nA suggestion: Since I have zero complaints, here‚Äôs a little thing for a sound series since you do some with pop music and such as calm remixes. Try to do some anime songs as a slowed down and calmer version. I bet there are more people out there who would want this as anime can be a sort of relief and break from reality and I find if it were mixed with calm it would be so much better ‚ù§Ô∏è",

It completely pulls me out of meditating because it feels so forced and fake. I put on Wind in the Willows for my daughter and Tamara‚Äôs voice sounded borderline inappropriate for kids with how breathy and passionate she tries to sound. \n\nTamara, with all respect, PLEASE consider using your normal speaking voice which is already perfectly pleasant! You already have a lovely voice! You don‚Äôt need to go so hard with the breathy false enthusiasm. It genuinely is a deal breaker for so much of the app‚Äôs content and it bums me out.",

I even played the baby shh (one of the sounds they have on there) for my fussy 2 month old niece when she, my brother and sister-in-law came to visit and she settled down and fell asleep quickly!  I am glad they have the option to pay for a yearly subscription as there is no way I can pay monthly.

Between meditations on different subjects to short guided yoga segments to OMG the Sleep Stories - this app has honestly changed my life and how I am dealing with every single thing in life, good, bad and ugly. \n\nThere is something for every part of the day. Most segments are a bit over ten minutes but there are longer as well.  There are too many options to list! And even just the sounds (waves to lakes to cat purring) are great to have in the background, especially if like me, you get a little overstimulated and benefit from gentle white noise as a reminder to slow down.\n\nI am so in love with this app!!! Best $60 I‚Äôve spent in ages, although I originally thought it was billed $5/month. At least it prompts me to get as much as I can out of it. \n\nMake the investment in YOU.

I feel really calm and it seems I have been gaining more focus on all aspect of my life. Now I wake up in the morning and am very excited to meditate and gets some daily wisdom from the instructors.

I‚Äôm not sure how this will do during those more intense times, BUT the sleep stories have knocked me out twice now and that is a MIRACLE. I love the celebrity stories and how well they tell them. I‚Äôve always been one to hyper focus on my thoughts or get lost in my day dreams or an annoying sounds so I never thought a sleep story would work, but I realized when I started to fall asleep during a lecture (while I was in my bed) that if I try to focus on something kinda boring I might be able to pass out üòÇ helps my mind not hyper focus! I‚Äôm still in the 7 day free trial so it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try!!",

Thank you so much for creating this app it helps me so much! I just started listening to the sleep stories on meditating because I have a lot going on in the pandemic and it helps so much!

    "content": "I bought this app during a deployment that was not very easy to get some shut eye. Being military, your body is pretty much trained to pass out whenever your not moving, however after the last few years of deploying, time zone changes, shift swaps, inconsiderate wall mates and the lack of understanding of ‚Äò24 hour quite hours‚Äô i needed something to help relax. This app, paired with Bose noise canceling headphones has saved my sanity. Throw on some bob ross or another wonderful sleep story, let the soothing sounds wash over you and drown out all the mindless chatter of the day. I also love that it plays a ‚Äòscene‚Äô afterwords, needing a constant ‚Äòsound‚Äô to over power the noises outside without being too much and this is perfect. Honestly I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without this app, especially overseas",

I find the guided meditations better suited for what I want in my meditation time  - A little less talking, more breathing, a choice between a female and male narration (I find the female voice to be less judgmental for some reason) and topic-focused, CBT-based thought reframing. I feel more centered and inspired after each session!\n\nThe sleep stories and sleep sound libraries have become a favorite feature I didn‚Äôt know I wanted. I‚Äôve been having some stress-related insomnia here and there, and the bedtime audio options pair really well with a lavender essential oil diffuser for relaxation and creating an enjoyable sleep hygiene routine. \n\nKeep it up, Calm team!

One night I was having an anxiety attack and decided to try and find a meditation app. Calm came up and I decided to look into it. The first thing I saw was the bedtime story ‚ÄúBlue Gold.‚Äù The reader had the most calming voice and the story took my mind back to a trip I had taken to France. I was asleep before the story was finished. In fact, I fall asleep before most of the stories are over and I stay asleep longer. There are so many different offerings, including the meditation I had been wanting. There is limited access to the free portion, so I decided to purchase the yearly subscription, and I am so happy I did. Really worth trying.",

If you don‚Äôt pay, it will only give you like 1 soundscape, 1 song, 1 book ETC. So I wish calm could not have the membership part, and I wish calm will one day fix all the glitches that come out.

I just beat my streak and am progressing happily.

    "content": "I used Headspace for years and loved it. My company now pays for the Calm app so I downloaded the app and used it. There‚Äôs one HUGE advantage that headspace has that I think calm could adopt. Any of the narrations that have a soundscape in the background, you have a slider to choose the volume of the narrator‚Äôs voice compared to the soundscape. This may not seem like a big deal, but for sleep stories it‚Äôs a huge deal. For anyone that uses sleep headphones with Calm, like me, in order to get a nice comfortable volume where you can hear the soundscape clearly, you have to turn it up so loud to where the narrator is too loud. Headspace slider takes care of this perfectly. Unfortunately even though my company pays for Calm, I‚Äôd rather pay to use Headapces just because of the slider volume function for sleep stories. If Calm can do the same thing, I‚Äôd gladly use their app. But as it is, Calm isn‚Äôt for me.",

    "content": "Today in my gratitude journal I noted I‚Äôm grateful for Tamara, a woman I‚Äôve never met and likely never will meet. When I graduated college 26 years ago I meditated for a while and it helped, but alas, I got out of the habit of making time for myself and 25 years went by before I‚Äôd find this app. It‚Äôs wonderful. Tamara is such an excellent guide with her comforting assurances that it‚Äôs okay to be restless or experience whatever emotions are distracting you, and gently bringing you back to the breath. I could go on, but I‚Äôll just finish by saying that Tamara and the other guides are superb and I am starting to love starting my day with Tamara‚Äôs daily calm. Like any other habit it takes time. Please invest that time in yourself because you‚Äôre worth it and you will benefit.",

    "content": "Unfortunately, I had a 50% off 12 month promo and also had asked for a giftcard for Christmas for the year that would be enough to cover the discounted price, which I received. Well Calm does not honor their giftcards the way most businesses do and would not let me redeem my giftcard to pay for the promo (credit card only). It was a waste of money and I lost out on 6 months of this expensive app because they would not honor their own giftcard as a form of payment. Customer service was no help and would not offer to assist me in correcting the matter. Of course giftcards are also non refundable, so it was just a waste. I‚Äôm not even sure how this is legal‚Ä¶ I doubt it is. Once I reached out, I am just in disbelief that they still would not help me or extend my membership by the remaining time at least. This is all so unfortunate since the app itself is nice. The company does not seem to value their customers.",

The app also acknowledges when you get a daily consecutive streak, which I find very encouraging!\n\nI would still consider myself a novice at meditation, but with the help of this app, it no longer feels like an impossible, scary thing.

If the point of the app is to reduce anxiety, this new feature is doing the exact opposite. Who cares about my streak!?! What‚Äôs important is that I use it to support myself as needed. The streak tracker feels very self serving on the part of Calm, to ensure eye balls on the app, and is a HUGE disappointment. I find myself using it less. Please change this feature!!!

Also, the other features such as music, story telling, etc. bring more joy and diversity to the tools of relaxing and being in spirit. This app makes a great impact because it guides you gently through the new experience of meditation if you are a beginner and if you are more experienced, it adds to the joy of relaxing and meditation with their creative, well thought of, and diverse mental ambience creator.",

Also, most of the meditations seem to be led by Tamara Levitt and I find her voice to be more annoying than soothing. She talks like a cinematic actress or a hypnotist and not just a person doing a meditation. What I love about Peloton is that they‚Äôre constantly adding new content and you have 5 different people you can listen to for all sorts of meditations. I think different personalities will speak to you and this app is disappointing, especially considering it‚Äôs $70/yr subscription. I‚Äôm also not into sleep stories. I want a nice 10-15 minute meditation before I go to bed and I want choice and perhaps some New Age music playing in the background. After having it several months I‚Äôve cancelled the subscription since I now favor Peloton to Calm.",

    "content": "I have been dealing with insomnia for years now. I‚Äôve tried herbs, oils, prescription meds, diet, exercise, and bedtime routine. All work for a short period of time, but the night waking with the incessant thoughts never end. I looked into meditation and came across this app. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me! For the first time in years, although I wake up through the night, with the help of the sleep releases and/or the bedtime stories, my mind is quieted and I go back to sleep! I do one meditation through the day and feel it helps me with my focus through the night. I have a ways to go to be an awesome meditator, but this app is awesome! I can‚Äôt stress that enough! I‚Äôve been using it for a month. It has been worth every dollar spent! I highly recommend it!",

I mean if u have a lot of money and i mean ($62 a year) go ahead spend your money but for the middle class out here we don't have money to be buying useless things we are probably only going to use once. Now lets go down into the pros and cons of the app. The cons are that it is a lot of money just to use the app, and that they only give one thing from each category if you decide to not buy the subscription and they are normally the ones no one one wants to use. Now on with the pros with the app is that as soon as you sign up the email you a 40% discount on that years subscription but sadly there is a con to that I forgot to mention. The discount only last for that year and that it the offer only last that night so after midnight your offer is gone so i hope you enjoy my experience with the app and i hope you have a good day.",

It‚Äôs wonderful to have such a rich healing environment always close at hand. These days I meditate solo with the open-ended timer set to a tropical beach wave for background sounds, with bells set for every five minutes‚Äîone set of choices among many options.

I canceled my subscription months ago and it is still billing me for the app that I am no longer using. It says it won't stop the payment until the renewal date which is in February.

This would allow me to play sounds in the background whilst listening to an audio book for instance. \n - It would also be nice to be able to mix sounds & scenes with Calm sleep stories. I find some of the stories too quiet and needing some extra background noise. \n\n2) If ever able to mix sounds with other apps it would be nice to control volume of the Calm app separately from the phone master volume (TaoMix has this feature currently). \n\n3) I‚Äôd like to be able to mix or overlap the sleep soundscapes for customer soundscapes. Oh, and more of the soundscapes, please, they‚Äôre great!\n\n4) It‚Äôs time to morph the scenes and sleep soundscapes into one category. I love a couple of the scenes and would be so sad if they were removed (specifically rhythmic waves and gently flowing stream - I could sleep to those any day!), but the others are a little dated and could be replaced with the sleep soundscapes and more of those added",

Like another reviewer, I‚Äôve tried and tried to no avail. My only resort is to turn it down to lowest audible volume. During the didactic part of the meditation, the voice changes to something more authentic, but then, relapses to the vocal fry and breathiness that seems designed to enhance the meditation experience. It obviously works for many users, and there‚Äôs no doubt that Tamara possesses wisdom and us a gifted teacher.

    "content": "I‚Äôve been using Calm for almost 3 years now on an almost daily basis. I think it did help me with a lot of issues and I do begin to notice benefits from using it in my life. The reason why I‚Äôm only giving 4 stars is that the ‚ÄûDaily Calm‚Äù sessions, something I used to look forward to, have been simple replays of previous sessions for a while now. That‚Äôs annoying, especially since they let you save your favorite sessions. So it happened to me a couple of times now that I played one of my favorite sessions and then the following day I listen to the exact same thing as a ‚Äúdaily Calm‚Äù because it‚Äôs being replayed. I think the daily sessions should be new, otherwise I feel a little fooled. Other than that I really like it.",

It has been studied that people with anxiety can experience mindfulness in order to cope with or eliminate their anxiety. Being mindful of one's experience \"in the moment\" (also known as meditation) and doing so without passing judgment clarifies one's values, enables acceptance of uncomfortable ideas and feelings, and the use of values to alter behavior.",

I use the sleep soundscapes the most, and play them on my HomePod. They helps covering the noise my neighbors do at any time of the night. The Commercial Airliner, and the White Sound Ocean Surf soundscapes are the best IMO for this kind of ‚Äúsound machine‚Äù feel.\nHowever, there are two notable issues I find pretty frustrating:\n1. The soundscape tracks are seemingly loops that repeat every X minutes (maybe 20, or 30minutes?). When the track ends, there‚Äôs a gap of a couple seconds before it‚Äôs starts again, which is enough to create this unpleasant ‚Äúwake up‚Äù experience.\n2. The playback experience in the app is buggy. It does not really say when it‚Äôs buffering (if at all?) but it does not always starts right away after selecting a soundscape, even though the playback UI shows as playing. Sometimes, playback does not even start until a couple seconds after backgrounding the app. That‚Äôs odd and not user friendly.\n\nIf that wasn‚Äôt for these two issues, I would give it 5 stars without hesitation.\n\nPlease Calm devs, help me being calmer by fixing these annoyances!",

I have spent so much time with him, I feel like I know him.  The experience has truly been transformative.  I began meditating on the advice of a counselor after experiencing a panic attack on an airplane. I have never had mental health issues and at 58 yoa, it came as a shock.  Not only has the meditation practice helped relieve my General Panic Disorder; but it has made me a much better person; and these are the words of my wife of 35 years and my adult children.  This has lead me down a path where I am now taking mindfulness classes in order to hopefully bring these tools to friends and colleagues.  Thank you Jeff and everyone at CALM!",

    "content": "Calm has been in the news lately‚Äîgood news, for doing good things‚Äîso when my subscription expired earlier this week, I was only too happy to renew it. I‚Äôve been using the app for a little over a year now, off and on (trying to be more on than off but sometimes keeping good habits is hard), and I find it very useful. It‚Äôs well organized, easy to navigate, lots of variety, and helpful reminders to make it a habit (assuming you respond to the reminders, lol). I also like that I can log in through my browser and play some of the music playlists on my computer while working. All in all, an excellent experience with this.",

There are so many fun extras in this app as well! You can track how your feeling each day. You can write short gratitude lists, and even go for a deep thinking question.  I‚Äôve had insomnia all my life.  I put on a sleep story and I‚Äôm out without worry or stress.  I tell everyone I know to get the app and subscribe!  My mother and I often joke about how long we can make it through a story.  Run don‚Äôt walk. Get this app and subscribe.   I would give this 100 stars if I could.  Bravo calm and thank you.",

My favorite features are listening to the scenes or the music, and of course the daily Calms. I love the sleep stories and Master Classes as well. I‚Äôve listed to the mindful eating and pillars of health master class at least 3 times each now! I have recommended and gifted this to my mom as well as some of my friends. I‚Äôve tried other meditation apps and this one seems to surpass them all in the user friendliness and quality (especially sound quality!). Highly recommend Calm to anyone looking for a great guided meditation app or someone to talk them to sleep at night :)",

    "content": "When I first got Calm about a year ago, I was really stressed out and couldn‚Äôt get to sleep. I was taking 6-10 mg of melatonin a night which was really unhealthy for my body (I am 13). Calm was truly a life changer because it taught me to meditate and had amazing sleep stories and a good amount of them were free. Then calm switched mostly all of their stuff to premium so I stopped using the app. After a visit to the doctor I was told to try meditation again and I immediately thought of calm. My parents capped the limit at $30 a year and they thought $60 was outrageous. I really think that calm is amazing and of you can pay for premium I definitely think it would be worth it.",

I also do gratitude tracking, mood tracking, and sleep tracking, and have seen way better sleep prioritizing, and reflection! I can‚Äôt recommend this app enough!

As soon as my head hits the pillows, it starts analyzing my day, and reminding me of all the things I should have done during the day, instead of the things i did do. It‚Äôs frustrating, but I‚Äôm getting a handle on it, sort of. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. But this app helps. Even if I can‚Äôt find sleep, I can find calm, find relaxing, find release of the troublesome thoughts or putting them where I can find them the next day and deal with them properly.",

They do have reminders but if I could set a meditation to start at a certain time I could do it without having to touch my phone (we all know how distracting phones are first thing in the morning)",

The ones I favor most I download to play offline.\n\nThis is a wonderful app if you want to decompress after a stressful day.  I would give it 5 stars if it was more affordable.

Often times the narrators voices aren‚Äôt soft and soothing and at times difficult to understand. Consequently I rely repeatedly on the few that offer what works best for me which is a soft spoken soothing bedtime story.  Thank you Calm for making our lives and the world more peaceful",

It may not be very zen of me, but I would like to get credit for all my meditation minutes. \n\nPreviously, you could send an email to the support team, but I can no longer find that option. All that's available is a chatbot, and it appears very basic. I don't want to sit around for an extended period of time talking to something that asks the same questions repeatedly and only seems to be able to refer me to articles in the archives. I want to correspond with a real person. Please help. Until then, I'll stick with the 1 star review.",

I made the mistake of updating my app in order to upgrade to a paid subscription, only to find the part of the app I was using was no longer there. The updated version offers breathing circles, but none have the same timing (even with using the limited controls offered) and there is no scene behind the circle. I can understand the app choosing to start charging for a popular item, but to take it away completely and then charge for something inferior is maddening. Paid subscribers should have better controls to fine tune the timing, a choice of music, and a choice of calming backgrounds behind the circle. Maddening to upgrade to a paid only to find the paid version is inferior to what was offered for free previously.",

I think you should add a feature where you can make a playlist. I‚Äôve found so many songs I like on the app but I don‚Äôt always like the rest of the album, so having a feature like this would allow people to make a kinda of mixed up playlist of songs or even sleep stories. Also as a side note, ever since the app updated it has been very glitchy when switching through tabs on the side bar and everywhere else in general.  Thanks for reading this far lol and I hope you‚Äôd consider my suggestion!",
